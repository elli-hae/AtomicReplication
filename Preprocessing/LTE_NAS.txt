Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

shall indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

shall not indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions "shall" and "shall not" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions "must" and "must not" are not used as substitutes for
"shall" and "shall not". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation
from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain
continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a
referenced document.

should indicates a recommendation to do something

should not indicates a recommendation not to do something

may indicates permission to do something

need not indicates permission not to do something

The construction "may not" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions "might not" or "shall not" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

can indicates that something is possible

cannot indicates that something is impossible

The constructions "can" and "cannot" are not substitutes for "may" and
"need not".

will indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

will not indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen
as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is
outside the scope of the present document

might indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope
of the present document

might not indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

is (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact

is not (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact

The constructions "is" and "is not" do not indicate requirements.

1 Scope

The present document specifies the procedures used by the protocols for
mobility management and session management between User Equipment (UE)
and Mobility Management Entity (MME) in the Evolved Packet System (EPS).
These protocols belong to the non-access stratum (NAS).

The EPS Mobility Management (EMM) protocol defined in the present
document provides procedures for the control of mobility when the User
Equipment (UE) is using the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access
Network (E-UTRAN). The EMM protocol also provides control of security
for the NAS protocols.

The EPS Session Management (ESM) protocol defined in the present
document provides procedures for the handling of EPS bearer contexts.
Together with the bearer control provided by the access stratum, this
protocol is used for the control of user plane bearers.

For both NAS protocols the present document specifies procedures for the
support of inter-system mobility between E‑UTRAN and other 3GPP or
non-3GPP access networks:

- For inter-system mobility between E-UTRAN and GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN,
this includes rules for a mapping between parameters and procedures used
by the NAS protocols defined in the present document and the NAS
protocols specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for GERAN and UTRAN, and
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for NG-RAN.

- For inter-system mobility between E-UTRAN and generic non-3GPP access
networks, this includes specific NAS procedures to maintain IP
connectivity to the PDN Gateway and to provide parameters needed by the
UE when using mobility management based on Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 (see
3GPP TS 24.303 [14]) or MIPv4 (see 3GPP TS 24.304 [15]).

The present document is applicable to the UE and to the Mobility
Management Entity (MME) in the EPS.

The present document is also applicable to the relay node in the EPS
(see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

The present document also specifies NAS signalling enhancement for the
support of efficient transport of IP, non-IP, Ethernet and SMS data of
CIoT capable devices.

EPS bearer context with QCI = 1 where there is a radio bearer associated
with that context.

Procedure Transaction Identity: An identity which is dynamically
allocated by the UE for the UE requested ESM procedures. The procedure
transaction identity is released when the procedure is completed.

types are used to distinguish different types of satellite E-UTRAN
access, as defined in 3GPP TS 38.413 [31]. In this version of the
specification, the defined satellite E-UTRAN RAT types are
"WB-E-UTRAN(LEO)", "WB-E-UTRAN(MEO)", " WB-E-UTRAN(GEO)", "NB-IoT(LEO)",
"NB-IoT(MEO)", "NB-IoT(GEO)", "LTE-M(LEO)", "LTE-M(MEO)" and
"LTE-M(GEO)".

SCEF PDN Connection: A PDN connection established between the UE and the
Service Capability Exposure Function (SCEF) for transmitting the UE's
non-IP data related to a specific application.

SGi PDN Connection: A PDN connection established between the UE and the
Packet Gateway (P-GW) for transmitting the UE's IP, non-IP or Ethernet

such that the traffic of the PDN connection will be using an L-GW. The
network authorizes an APN for using SIPTO at the local network based on
the subscription profile (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [16C]) and subsequently the
network considers this PDN connection a SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection. SIPTO at the local network PDN connection can be of IP,
non-IP or Ethernet PDN type.

SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with a collocated L-GW: A
SIPTO at the local network PDN connection which is established to a L-GW
function collocated with the (H)(e)NodeB. The core-network entity (i.e.
the MME or the SGSN) can be aware of whether the SIPTO at the local
network PDN connection with a collocated L-GW is used when the PDN
connection is established.

SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with a stand-alone GW: A SIPTO
at the local network PDN connection which is established to a
stand-alone GW (with collocated L-GW and S-GW). The core-network entity
(i.e. the MME or the SGSN) can be aware of whether the SIPTO at the
local network PDN connection with a stand-alone GW is used when the PDN
connection is established.

"SMS only": A subset of services which includes only Short Message
Service. A UE camping on E-UTRAN can attach to both EPS services and
"SMS only".

SMS over NAS: refers to SMS in MME or SMS over SGs.

SMS over S102: refers to SMS which uses 1xCS procedures in EPS as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.272 [9].

Subscribed APN based congestion control: Congestion control in mobility
management where the network can reject attach requests from UEs with a
certain APN in the subscription.

TAI list: A list of TAIs that identify the tracking areas that the UE
can enter without performing a tracking area updating procedure. The
TAIs in a TAI list assigned by an MME to a UE pertain to the same MME
area.

Traffic flow aggregate: A temporary aggregate of packet filters that are
included in a UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or a UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure and that is inserted
into a traffic flow template (TFT) for an EPS bearer context by the
network once the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure is completed.

UE configured for dual priority: A UE which provides dual priority
support is configured for NAS signalling low priority and also
configured to override the NAS signalling low priority indicator (see
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A], 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN: A UE configured with at
least one access class in the range 11-15 on the USIM, and the access
class is applicable in the selected PLMN according to
3GPP TS 22.011 [1A].

UE's availability for voice calls in the IMS: The indication of this
availability or non-availability is provided by the upper layers of the
UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] in the annex relevant to the
IP-Connectivity Access Network in use or determined in the NAS layer, as
specified in clause 4.3.1. If availability is indicated, the UE uses the
IM CN Subsystem and can terminate or originate requests for SIP sessions
including an audio component with codecs suited for voice.

UE's usage setting: This is a UE setting that indicates whether the UE
has preference for voice services over data services or vice-versa. If a
UE has preference for voice services, then the UE's usage setting is
"voice centric". If a UE has preference for data services, then the UE's
usage setting is "data centric". A UE whose setting is "data centric"
may still require access to voice services. A UE whose setting is "voice
centric" may still require access to data services. This definition is
derived from 3GPP TS 23.221 [8A] and it applies to voice capable UEs. If
the UE is capable of both S1 mode and N1 mode, there is a single UE's
usage setting which applies to both 5GS and EPS (see
3GPP TS 24.501 [54]).

UE supporting CIoT EPS optimizations: A UE that supports control plane
CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization and one or
more other CIoT EPS optimizations when the UE is in S1 mode.

UE using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization: A UE
that is attached for EPS services with the control plane CIOT EPS
optimization accepted by the network.

4.1 Overview

The non-access stratum (NAS) described in the present document forms the
highest stratum of the control plane between UE and MME at the radio
interface (reference point "LTE-Uu"; see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

Main functions of the protocols that are part of the NAS are:

- the support of mobility of the user equipment (UE); and

- the support of session management procedures to establish and maintain
IP connectivity between the UE and a packet data network gateway (PDN
GW).

NAS security is an additional function of the NAS providing services to
the NAS protocols, e.g. integrity protection and ciphering of NAS
signalling messages.

For the support of the above functions, the following procedures are
supplied within this specification:

- elementary procedures for EPS mobility management in clause 5; and

- elementary procedures for EPS session management in clause 6.

Complete NAS transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary
procedures. Examples of such specific sequences can be found in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

The NAS for EPS follows the protocol architecture model for layer 3 as
described in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]; however, due to the objective of EPS
to provide the subscriber with a "ready-to-use" IP connectivity and an
"always-on" experience, the protocol supports a linkage between mobility
management and session management procedures during the attach procedure
(see clause 4.2).

Signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are described as
part of the EPS mobility management in clause 5. In addition to that,
principles for the handing of EPS security contexts and for the
activation of ciphering and integrity protection, when a NAS signalling
connection is established, are provided in clause 4.4.

4.2 Linkage between the protocols for EPS mobility management and EPS session management

During the EPS attach procedure, the network can activate a default EPS
bearer context (i.e. if the UE requests PDN connectivity in the attach
request). Additionally, the network can activate one or several
dedicated EPS bearer contexts in parallel for PDN connections of IP or
Ethernet PDN type. To this purpose the EPS session management messages
for the default EPS bearer context activation can be transmitted in an
information element in the EPS mobility management messages. In this
case, the UE and the network execute the attach procedure, the default
EPS bearer context activation procedure, and the dedicated EPS bearer
context activation procedure in parallel. The UE and network shall
complete the combined default EPS bearer context activation procedure
and the attach procedure before the dedicated EPS bearer context
activation procedure is completed. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, then the success of
the attach procedure is dependent on the success of the default EPS
bearer context activation procedure. If the attach procedure fails, then
the ESM procedures also fail.

A UE using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization can
initiate transport of user data via the control plane. For this purpose
a UE in EMM-IDLE mode can initiate the service request procedure and
transmit the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message in an information element in the
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

Except for the attach procedure and the service request procedure,
during EMM procedures the MME shall suspend the transmission of ESM
messages. During the service request procedure the MME may suspend the
transmission of ESM messages.

Except for the attach procedure and the service request procedure for UE
initiated transport of user data via the control plane, during EMM
procedures the UE shall suspend the transmission of ESM messages.

4.2A Handling of NAS signalling low priority indication

A UE configured for NAS signalling low priority (see
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A], 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) indicates this by including
the Device properties IE in the appropriate NAS message and setting the
low priority indicator to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
priority", except for the following cases in which the UE shall set the
low priority indicator to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low
priority":

- the UE is performing an attach for emergency bearer services;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established
and is performing EPS mobility management procedures, or is establishing
a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

- the UE configured for dual priority is requested by the upper layers
to establish a PDN connection with the low priority indicator set to "MS
is not configured for NAS signalling low priority";

- the UE configured for dual priority is performing EPS session
management procedures related to the PDN connection established with low
priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low
priority";

- the UE configured for dual priority has a PDN connection established
by setting the low priority indicator to "MS is not configured for NAS
signalling low priority" and is performing EPS mobility management
procedures;

- the UE is performing a service request procedure for a CS fallback
emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call;

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN; or

- the UE is responding to paging.

The network may use the NAS signalling low priority indication for NAS
level mobility management congestion control and APN based congestion
control.

If the NAS signalling low priority indication is provided in a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the MME stores the NAS signalling low
priority indication within the default EPS bearer context activated due
to the PDN connectivity request procedure.

4.3 UE mode of operation

4.3.1 General

A UE attached for EPS services shall operate in one of the following
operation modes:

- PS mode 1 of operation: the UE registers only to EPS services, and
UE's usage setting is "voice centric";

- PS mode 2 of operation: the UE registers only to EPS services, and
UE's usage setting is "data centric";

- CS/PS mode 1 of operation: the UE registers to both EPS and non-EPS
services, and UE's usage setting is "voice centric"; and

- CS/PS mode 2 of operation: the UE registers to both EPS and non-EPS
services, and UE's usage setting is "data centric".

A UE configured to use CS fallback, shall operate in CS/PS mode 1 or
CS/PS mode 2. Such UE may also be configured to use IMS, in which case
the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN as defined in
3GPP TS 24.167 [13B] shall be used for the selection of the domain for
originating voice communication services.

NOTE 1: The domain selected for originating voice communication services
can be ignored by attempting a CS emergency call.

Upon request from upper layers to establish a CS emergency call:

- if the UE needs to initiate a CS fallback emergency call but it is
unable to perform CS fallback, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or
UTRAN radio access technology, and a UE with "IMS voice not available"
should disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5) to allow a
potential callback, and then progress the CS emergency call
establishment;

- if the UE needs to initiate a 1xCS fallback emergency call but it is
unable to perform 1xCS fallback, the UE shall attempt to select
cdma2000® 1x radio access technology to establish the call.

NOTE 2: Unable to perform CS fallback or 1xCS fallback means that either
the UE was not allowed to attempt CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, or CS
fallback or 1xCS fallback attempt failed.

A UE configured to use SMS over SGs shall operate in CS/PS mode 1 or
CS/PS mode 2.

The behaviour of the UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation, upon failure to
access the CS domain or upon reception of a "CS fallback not preferred"
or "SMS only" indication, will depend on the availability of voice over
IMS. In the present document, "IMS voice not available" refers to one of
the following conditions:

a) the UE is not configured to use IMS;

b) the UE is not configured to use IMS voice, i.e. when the voice domain
preference for E-UTRAN, as defined in 3GPP TS 24.167 [13B], indicates
that voice communication services are allowed to be invoked only over
the CS domain;

c) the UE is configured to use IMS voice, but the network indicates in
the ATTACH ACCEPT message or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
that IMS voice over PS sessions are not supported; or

d) the UE is configured to use IMS voice, the network indicates in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that
IMS voice over PS sessions are supported, but the upper layers:

- provide no indication that the UE is available for voice call in the
IMS within a manufacturer determined period of time; or

- indicate that the UE is not available for voice calls in the IMS.

NOTE 3: If conditions a, b and c evaluate to false, the upper layers
need time to attempt IMS registration. In the event an indication from
the upper layers that the UE is available for voice calls in the IMS
takes longer than the manufacturer determined period of time (e.g. due
to delay when attempting IMS registration or due to delay obtaining an
EPS bearer context for SIP signalling), the NAS layer assumes the UE is
not available for voice calls in the IMS.

Other conditions may exist but these are implementation specific.

In the present document, "IMS voice available" refers to the conditions
a, b, c and d, and other implementation specific conditions for "IMS
voice not available" evaluate to false.

4.3.2 Change of UE mode of operation

4.3.2.1 General

The UE mode of operation can change as a result of e.g.:

- a change of UE's usage setting for a CS voice capable UE;

- a change of voice domain preference for E-UTRAN as defined in
3GPP TS 24.167 [13B] for a CS voice capable UE;

- a change in the UE's availability for voice calls in the IMS; or

- a change in UE configuration regarding the use of SMS as defined in
3GPP TS 24.167 [13B].

Figure 4.3.2.1.1 and figure 4.3.2.1.2 illustrate the transitions between
different UE mode of operations when UE's usage settings, voice domain
preference for E-UTRAN or configuration regarding SMS changes.

[]

NOTE 1: The UE may transit from CS/PS mode 1 to PS mode 1 or from CS/PS
mode 2 to PS mode 2 if "CS domain not available" is received. After the
transition to PS mode 1 or PS mode 2 due to "CS domain not available",
the UE can transit back to CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2, e.g. due to
change of PLMN which is not in the list of the equivalent PLMNs.

NOTE 2: Not all possible transitions are shown in this figure.

voice capability

4.3.2.2 Change of UE's usage setting

Whenever the UE's usage setting changes, the UE dependent on its mode of
operation shall execute procedures according to table 4.3.2.2.1 and
table 4.3.2.2.2:

4.4 NAS security

4.4.1 General

This clause describes the principles for the handling of EPS security
contexts in the UE and in the MME and the procedures used for the
security protection of EPS NAS messages between UE and MME. Security
protection involves integrity protection and ciphering of the EMM and
ESM NAS messages.

The signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are part of
the EMM protocol and are described in detail in clause 5.

NOTE: The use of ciphering in a network is an operator option. In this
clause, for the ease of description, it is assumed that ciphering is
used, unless explicitly indicated otherwise. Operation of a network
without ciphering is achieved by configuring the MME so that it always
selects the "null ciphering algorithm", EEA0.

4.4.2 Handling of EPS security contexts

4.4.2.1 General

The security parameters for authentication, integrity protection and
ciphering are tied together in an EPS security context and identified by
a key set identifier for E-UTRAN (eKSI). The relationship between the
security parameters is defined in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

Before security can be activated, the MME and the UE need to establish
an EPS security context. Usually, the EPS security context is created as
the result of an EPS authentication procedure between MME and UE.
Alternatively:

- during inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode
to S1 mode, the MME and the UE derive a mapped EPS security context from
a UMTS security context that has been established while the UE was in
A/Gb mode or Iu mode; or

- during CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu
mode to S1 mode, the MME and the UE derive a mapped EPS security context
from a CS UMTS security context that has been established while the UE
was in A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

The EPS security context is taken into use by the UE and the MME, when
the MME initiates a security mode control procedure or during the
inter-system handover procedure from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to
S1 mode. The EPS security context which has been taken into use by the
network most recently is called current EPS security context. This
current EPS security context can be of type native or mapped, i.e.
originating from a native EPS security context or mapped EPS security
context.

The key set identifier eKSI is assigned by the MME either during the EPS
authentication procedure or, for the mapped EPS security context, during
the inter-system handover procedure. The eKSI consists of a value and a
type of security context parameter indicating whether an EPS security
context is a native EPS security context or a mapped EPS security
context. When the EPS security context is a native EPS security context,
the eKSI has the value of KSI_(ASME), and when the current EPS security
context is of type mapped, the eKSI has the value of KSI_(SGSN).

The EPS security context which is indicated by an eKSI can be taken into
use to establish the secure exchange of NAS messages when a new NAS
signalling connection is established without executing a new EPS
authentication procedure (see clause 4.4.2.3) or when the MME initiates
a security mode control procedure. For this purpose the initial NAS
messages (i.e. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, DETACH
REQUEST, SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST, and CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST) and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contain an eKSI
in the NAS key set identifier IE or the value part of eKSI in the KSI
and sequence number IE indicating the current EPS security context used
to integrity protect the NAS message.

In the present document, when the UE is required to delete an eKSI, the
UE shall set the eKSI to the value "no key is available" and consider
also the associated keys K_(ASME) or K'_(ASME), EPS NAS ciphering key
and EPS NAS integrity key invalid (i.e. the EPS security context
associated with the eKSI as no longer valid).

NOTE: In some specifications the term ciphering key sequence number
might be used instead of the term Key Set Identifier (KSI).

The UE and the MME need to be able to maintain two EPS security contexts
simultaneously, i.e. a current EPS security context and a non-current
EPS security context, since:

- after an EPS re-authentication, the UE and the MME can have both a
current EPS security context and a non-current EPS security context
which has not yet been taken into use (i.e. a partial native EPS
security context); and

- after an inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to
S1 mode, the UE and the MME can have both a mapped EPS security context,
which is the current EPS security context, and a non-current native EPS
security context that was created during a previous access in S1 mode or
S101 mode.

The number of EPS security contexts that need to be maintained
simultaneously by the UE and the MME is limited by the following
requirements:

- After a successful EPS (re-)authentication, which creates a new
partial native EPS security context, the MME and the UE shall delete the
non-current EPS security context, if any.

- When a partial native EPS security context is taken into use through a
security mode control procedure, the MME and the UE shall delete the
previously current EPS security context.

- When the MME and the UE create an EPS security context using null
integrity and null ciphering algorithm during an attach procedure for
emergency bearer services, or a tracking area updating procedure for a
UE that has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services (see
clause 5.4.3.2), the MME and the UE shall delete the previous current
EPS security context. The UE shall not update the USIM and non-volatile
ME memory with the current EPS security context and shall delete the
current EPS security context when the UE is detached from emergency
services (e.g. before attaching for normal service).

- When a new mapped EPS security context or EPS security context created
using null integrity and null ciphering algorithm is taken into use
during the inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to
S1 mode, the MME and the UE shall not delete the previously current
native EPS security context, if any. Instead, the previously current
native EPS security context shall become a non-current native EPS
security context, and the MME and the UE shall delete any partial native
EPS security context.

If no previously current native EPS security context exists, the MME and
the UE shall not delete the partial native EPS security context, if any.

- When the MME and the UE derive a new mapped EPS security context
during inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1
mode, the MME and the UE shall delete any existing current mapped EPS
security context.

- When a non-current full native EPS security context is taken into use
by a security mode control procedure, then the MME and the UE shall
delete the previously current mapped EPS security context.

- When the UE or the MME moves from EMM-REGISTERED to EMM-DEREGISTERED
state, if the current EPS security context is a mapped EPS security
context and a non-current full native EPS security context exists, then
the non-current EPS security context shall become the current EPS
security context. Furthermore, the UE and the MME shall delete any
mapped EPS security context or partial native EPS security context.

The UE shall mark the EPS security context on the USIM or in the
non-volatile memory as invalid when the UE initiates an attach procedure
as described in clause 5.5.1 or when the UE leaves state
EMM-DEREGISTERED for any other state except EMM-NULL.

The UE shall store the current native EPS security context as specified
in annex C and mark it as valid only when the UE enters state
EMM-DEREGISTERED from any other state except EMM-NULL or when the UE
aborts the attach procedure without having left EMM-DEREGISTERED.

4.4.2.2 Establishment of a mapped EPS security context during intersystem handover

In order for the UE to derive a mapped EPS security context for an
inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in
EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall generate a KSI_(SGSN), create a
nonce_(MME) and generate the K'_(ASME) using the created nonce_(MME) as
indicated in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]. The MME shall include the selected NAS
algorithms, nonce_(MME) and generated KSI_(SGSN) (associated with the
K'_(ASME)) in the NAS security transparent container for handover to
E-UTRAN. The MME shall derive the EPS NAS keys from K'_(ASME).

When the UE receives the command to perform handover to E-UTRAN, the UE
shall derive K'_(ASME,) as indicated in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], using the
nonce_(MME) received in the NAS security transparent container.
Furthermore, the UE shall associate the derived K'_(ASME) with the
received KSI_(SGSN) and derive the EPS NAS keys from K'_(ASME).

When the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services and has
no current UMTS security context, the MME shall set EIA0 and EEA0 as the
selected NAS security algorithms in the NAS security transparent
container for handover to E-UTRAN. The MME shall create a locally
generated K'_(ASME). The MME shall set the KSI value of the associated
security context to "000" and the type of security context flag to
"mapped security context" in the NAS security transparent container for
handover to E-UTRAN.

When the UE receives the command to perform handover to E-UTRAN and has
a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, if EIA0 and EEA0 as the
selected NAS security algorithms are included in the NAS security
transparent container for handover to E-UTRAN, the UE shall create a
locally generated K'_(ASME). The UE shall set the KSI value of the
associated security context to the KSI value received.

If the inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in
EMM-CONNECTED mode is not completed successfully, the MME and the UE
shall delete the new mapped EPS security context.

The establishment of a mapped EPS security context during inter-system
change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode is specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] clause 4.4.2.4.

4.4.2.3 Establishment of secure exchange of NAS messages

Secure exchange of NAS messages via a NAS signalling connection is
usually established by the MME during the attach procedure by initiating
a security mode control procedure. After successful completion of the
security mode control procedure, all NAS messages exchanged between the
UE and the MME are sent integrity protected using the current EPS
security algorithms, and except for the messages specified in
clause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are
sent ciphered using the current EPS security algorithms.

During inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1
mode, secure exchange of NAS messages is established between the MME and
the UE by:

- the transmission of NAS security related parameters encapsulated in
the AS signalling from the MME to the UE triggering the inter-system
handover (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]). The UE uses these parameters to
generate the mapped EPS security context; and,

- after the handover, the transmission of a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message from the UE to the MME. The UE shall send this message integrity
protected using the mapped EPS security context, but unciphered. From
this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent integrity protected using the mapped EPS security context, and
except for the messages specified in clause 4.4.5, all NAS messages
exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered using the mapped
EPS security context.

During inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED
mode, secure exchange of NAS messages is established between the MME and
the UE by:

- the transmission of NAS security related parameters encapsulated in
the AS signalling from the AMF to the UE triggering the inter-system
handover (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [56]). The UE uses these parameters to
generate the mapped EPS security context (see clause 8.6.1 of
3GPP TS 33.501 [56]); and

- after the handover, the transmission of a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message from the UE to the MME. The UE shall send this message integrity
protected using the mapped EPS security context, but unciphered. From
this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME
are sent integrity protected using the mapped EPS security context, and
except for the messages specified in clause 4.4.5, all NAS messages
exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered using the mapped
EPS security context.

During inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if
the UE is operating in the single-registration mode and:

1) if the tracking area updating procedure is initiated as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54], the UE shall transmit a TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message integrity protected with the current 5G NAS security
context and the UE shall derive a mapped EPS security context (see
clause 8.6.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [56]). The UE shall set the uplink and
downlink NAS COUNT counters to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT
counters of the current 5G NAS security context respectively. The UE
shall include the eKSI indicating the 5G NAS security context value in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

After receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including the
eKSI, the MME forwards the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the
source AMF, if possible, to obtain the mapped EPS security context from
the AMF as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [56]. The MME shall store the
mapped EPS NAS security context with the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT
counters associated with the derived K'ASME key set to the uplink and
downlink NAS COUNT counters of the mapped EPS NAS security context
respectively. The MME re-establishes the secure exchange of NAS messages
by either:

- replying with a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that is integrity
protected and ciphered using the mapped EPS security context. From this
time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are
sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in
clause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are
sent ciphered; or

- initiating a security mode control procedure. This can be used by the
MME to take a non-current EPS security context into use or to modify the
current EPS security context by selecting new NAS security algorithms;
or

2) if the attach procedure is initiated as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] and:

a) if the UE has received an "interworking without N26 interface not
supported" indication from the network and the UE has a valid 5G NAS
security context, the UE shall send an ATTACH REQUEST message integrity
protected with the current 5G NAS security context and the UE shall
derive a mapped EPS security context (see clause 8.6.1 of
3GPP TS 33.501 [56]). The UE shall set the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT
counters to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of the current 5G
NAS security context respectively. The UE shall include the eKSI
indicating the 5G NAS security context value in the ATTACH REQUEST
message.

After receiving the ATTACH REQUEST message including the eKSI, the MME
forwards the ATTACH REQUEST message to the source AMF, if possible, to
obtain the mapped EPS security context from the AMF as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 [56]. The MME shall store the mapped EPS NAS security
context with the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters associated with
the derived K'ASME key set to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters
of the mapped EPS NAS security context respectively. The MME
re-establishes the secure exchange of NAS messages by either:

- replying with an ATTACH ACCEPT message that is integrity protected and
ciphered using the mapped EPS NAS security context. From this time
onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent
integrity protected and except for the messages specified in
clause 4.4.5, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are
sent ciphered; or

- initiating a security mode control procedure. This can be used by the
MME to modify the current EPS security context by selecting new NAS
security algorithms; or

b) otherwise:

i) if the UE has a valid native EPS security context, the UE shall send
an ATTACH REQUEST message integrity protected with the native EPS
security context. The UE shall include the eKSI indicating the native
EPS security context value in the ATTACH REQUEST message.

After receiving the ATTACH REQUEST message including the eKSI, the MME
shall check whether the eKSI included in the initial NAS message belongs
to an EPS security context available in the MME, and shall verify the
MAC of the NAS message. If the verification is successful, the MME
re-establishes the secure exchange of NAS messages by either:

- replying with an ATTACH ACCEPT message that is integrity protected and
ciphered using the current EPS security context. From this time onward,
all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent integrity
protected and except for the messages specified in clause 4.4.5, all NAS
messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered; or

- initiating a security mode control procedure. This can be used by the
MME to modify the current EPS security context by selecting new NAS
security algorithms; or

ii) if the UE has no valid native EPS security context, the UE shall
send an ATTACH REQUEST message without integrity protection and
encryption.

The secure exchange of NAS messages shall be continued after S1 mode to
S1 mode handover. It is terminated after inter-system handover from S1
mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode or when the NAS signalling connection is
released.

When a UE in EMM-IDLE mode establishes a new NAS signalling connection
and has a valid current EPS security context, secure exchange of NAS
messages can be re-established in the following ways:

1) Except for the cases described in items 3 and 4 below, the UE shall
transmit the initial NAS message integrity protected with the current
EPS security context, but unciphered. The UE shall include the eKSI
indicating the current EPS security context value in the initial NAS
message. The MME shall check whether the eKSI included in the initial
NAS message belongs to an EPS security context available in the MME, and
shall verify the MAC of the NAS message. If the verification is
successful, the MME may re-establish the secure exchange of NAS
messages:

- by replying with a NAS message that is integrity protected and
ciphered using the current EPS security context. From this time onward,
all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent integrity
protected and except for the messages specified in clause 4.4.5, all NAS
messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered; or

- by initiating a security mode control procedure. This can be used by
the MME to take a non-current EPS security context into use or to modify
the current EPS security context by selecting new NAS security
algorithms; or

2) If the initial NAS message was a SERVICE REQUEST message or EXTENDED
SERVICE REQUEST message, secure exchange of NAS messages is triggered by
the indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearers
are successfully set up. After successful completion of the procedure,
all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent integrity
protected and except for the messages specified in clause 4.4.5, all NAS
messages exchanged between the UE and the MME are sent ciphered.

3) If the UE has no current EPS security context and performs a tracking
area updating procedure after an inter-system change in idle mode from
A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the UE shall send the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message without integrity protection and
encryption. The UE shall include a nonce and a GPRS ciphering key
sequence number for creation of a mapped EPS security context. The MME
creates a fresh mapped EPS security context and takes this context into
use by initiating a security mode control procedure and this context
becomes the current EPS security context in both the UE and the MME.
This re-establishes the secure exchange of NAS messages.

4) If the initial NAS message is a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
message, the UE shall send the message integrity protected. If an ESM
message container information element or a NAS message container
information element is included the message shall be sent partially
ciphered (see clause 4.4.5), otherwise the message shall be sent
unciphered. Secure exchange of NAS messages is re-established in the UE:

- by the indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio
bearers are successfully set up;

- upon receipt of a NAS message (e.g. a SERVICE ACCEPT message or ESM
DATA TRANSPORT message) that is integrity protected and ciphered using
the current EPS security context; or

- upon receipt of a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that has successfully
passed the integrity check.

4.4.2.4 Change of security keys

When the MME initiates a re-authentication to create a new EPS security
context, the messages exchanged during the authentication procedure are
integrity protected and ciphered using the current EPS security context,
if any.

Both UE and MME shall continue to use the current EPS security context,
until the MME initiates a security mode control procedure. The SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message sent by the MME includes the eKSI of the new EPS
security context to be used. The MME shall send the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message integrity protected with the new EPS security context,
but unciphered. When the UE responds with a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE, it
shall send the message integrity protected and ciphered with the new EPS
security context.

The MME can also modify the current EPS security context or take the
non-current native EPS security context, if any, into use, by sending a
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including the eKSI of the EPS security
context to be modified and including a new set of selected NAS security
algorithms. In this case the MME shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message integrity protected with the modified EPS security context, but
unciphered. When the UE replies with a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message,
it shall send the message integrity protected and ciphered with the
modified EPS security context.

4.4.2.5 Derivation of keys at CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode

At change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode due to CS
to PS SRVCC handover (see 3GPP TS 23.216 [8]), the UE shall derive a
mapped EPS security context for the PS domain from the UMTS security
context for the CS domain.

At change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode due to CS to PS SRVCC handover,
ciphering may be started and integrity protection shall be started (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) without any new authentication procedure.

NOTE 1: CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu
mode to S1 mode is not supported if the current CS security context is a
GSM security context.

NOTE 2: For emergency calls, CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to
S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode is not supported.

In order to derive a mapped EPS security context for a CS to PS SRVCC
handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, the MSC creates a
NONCE_(MSC) and generates the CK'_(PS) and IK'_(PS) using the CS UMTS
integrity key, the CS UMTS ciphering key and the created NONCE_(MSC) as
specified in annex B.6 in 3GPP TS 33.102 [18]. The MSC associates the
CK'_(PS) and IK'_(PS) with a KSI'_(PS). The KSI'_(PS) is set to the
value of the KSI_(CS) associated with the CS UMTS integrity key and the
CS UMTS ciphering key. The MSC transfers the CK'_(PS), IK'_(PS) and the
KSI'_(PS) to the MME. The MME shall create a mapped EPS security context
by setting the K'_(ASME) to the concatenation of the CK'_(PS) and
IK'_(PS) received from the MSC (i.e. CK'_(PS) || IK'_(PS)). The MME
shall associate the K'_(ASME) with a KSI_(SGSN). The MME shall set
KSI_(SGSN) to the value of the KSI'_(PS) received from the MSC. The MME
shall include the selected NAS algorithms, NONCE_(MME) and generated
KSI_(SGSN) (associated with the K'_(ASME)) in the NAS security
transparent container for the handover to E-UTRAN. The MME shall derive
the EPS NAS keys from K'_(ASME).

When the UE receives the command to perform CS to PS SRVCC handover to
S1 mode, the ME shall generate the CK'_(PS) and IK'_(PS) using the CS
UMTS integrity key, the CS UMTS ciphering key and the received
NONCE_(MSC) value in the transparent container in the CS to PS SRVCC
handover command as specified in annex B.6 in 3GPP TS 33.102 [18]. The
ME shall ignore the NONCE_(MME) value received in the NAS Security
Transparent Container in the CS to PS SRVCC handover command.

NOTE 3: The NONCE_(MME) value received in the NAS Security Transparent
Container for the handover to E-UTRAN is not used by the ME or MME in
any key derivation in this handover.

The ME shall create the key K'_(ASME) by concatenating the derived
CK'_(PS) and IK'_(PS) (i.e. CK'_(PS) || IK'_(PS.)). The ME shall
associate the derived key K'_(ASME) with a KSI_(SGSN). The ME shall set
the KSI_(SGSN) associated to K'_(ASME) to the KSI_(SGSN) value received
in the NAS Security Transparent Container from the network.

NOTE 4: Although this case is related to the MSC server enhanced for
SRVCC, the name KSI_(SGSN) is kept to avoid introducing a new name for
the same domain.

The ME shall derive the EPS NAS keys (CK' and IK') from the K'_(ASME) as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]. The ME shall apply these derived EPS
NAS security keys (CK' and IK'), reset the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT
values for the mapped EPS security context (i.e. to the value 0), and
replace an already established mapped EPS security context for the PS
domain, if any, in the ME, when the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb
mode or Iu mode has been completed successfully. If the already
established current EPS security context is of type native, then it
shall become the non-current native EPS security context and overwrite
any existing non-current native EPS security context in the ME.

The network shall replace an already established mapped EPS security
context for the PS domain, if any, when the CS to PS SRVCC handover from
A/Gb mode or Iu mode has been completed successfully. If the already
established current EPS security context is of type native, then it
shall become the non-current native EPS security context and overwrite
any existing non-current native EPS security context in the MME.

If the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has not been
completed successfully, the UE and the network shall delete the new
derived mapped EPS security context for the PS domain. Additionally, the
network shall delete an already established mapped EPS security context
for the PS domain, if any, if the eKSI of the already established EPS
security context is equal to the KSI_(SGSN) of the new derived EPS
security context for the PS domain.

4.4.3 Handling of NAS COUNT and NAS sequence number

4.4.3.1 General

Each EPS security context shall be associated with two separate counters
NAS COUNT: one related to uplink NAS messages and one related to
downlink NAS messages. The NAS COUNT counters use 24 bit internal
representation and are independently maintained by UE and MME. The NAS
COUNT shall be constructed as a NAS sequence number (8 least significant
bits) concatenated with a NAS overflow counter (16 most significant
bits).

When NAS COUNT is input to NAS ciphering or NAS integrity algorithms it
shall be considered to be a 32-bit entity which shall be constructed by
padding the 24-bit internal representation with 8 zeros in the most
significant bits.

The value of the uplink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM
or non-volatile memory as described in annex C, is the value that shall
be used in the next NAS message.

The value of the downlink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the
USIM or non-volatile memory as described in annex C, is the largest
downlink NAS COUNT used in a successfully integrity checked NAS message.

The value of the uplink NAS COUNT stored in the MME is the largest
uplink NAS COUNT used in a successfully integrity checked NAS message.

The value of the downlink NAS COUNT stored in the MME is the value that
shall be used in the next NAS message.

The NAS sequence number part of the NAS COUNT shall be exchanged between
the UE and the MME as part of the NAS signalling. After each new or
retransmitted outbound security protected NAS message, the sender shall
increase the NAS COUNT number by one, except for the initial NAS
messages if the lower layers indicated the failure to establish the RRC
connection (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). Specifically, on the sender side,
the NAS sequence number shall be increased by one, and if the result is
zero (due to wrap around), the NAS overflow counter shall also be
incremented by one (see clause 4.4.3.5). The receiving side shall
estimate the NAS COUNT used by the sending side. Specifically, if the
estimated NAS sequence number wraps around, the NAS overflow counter
shall be incremented by one.

NOTE 0: When estimating a NAS COUNT, the receiver is required to ensure
that a given NAS COUNT value is accepted at most one time, as specified
in clause 4.4.3.2.

After the derivation of a NAS token due to an inter-system change from
S1mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode in idle mode as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13], the UE shall increase the uplink NAS COUNT by one.

When the MME receives a NAS token via SGSN during an idle mode
inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode, the MME shall
check the NAS token as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], clause 9.1.1,
and update its uplink NAS COUNT with the uplink NAS COUNT value used for
the successful check of the NAS token.

NOTE 1: The MME does not check the NAS token if it is received via SGSN
during a connected mode inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or
Iu mode.

During the handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, when a mapped EPS
security context is derived and taken into use, the MME shall set both
the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this EPS security context
to zero. The UE shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT
counters to zero.

When a mapped EPS security context is derived as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 [56] and taken into use in the following cases:

- during the inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in
5GMM-CONNECTED mode; or

- during the inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE
mode for the UE operating in single-registration mode in a network
supporting N26 interface,

the MME shall store the mapped EPS NAS security context with the uplink
and downlink NAS COUNT counters associated with the derived K'_(ASME)
key set to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of the mapped EPS
NAS security context respectively. The UE shall set the uplink and
downlink NAS COUNT counters to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT
counters of the current 5G NAS security context respectively.

During the handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN the MME signals the
current downlink NAS COUNT value in a NAS security transparent container
(see clause 9.9.2.6).

During handover to or from E-UTRAN, the MME shall increment downlink NAS
COUNT by one after it has created a NAS security transparent container
(see clause 9.9.2.6 and 9.9.2.7).

NOTE 2: During the handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, the NAS
security transparent container (see clause 9.9.2.7) is treated as an
implicit SECURITY MODE COMMAND message for the UE and the MME, and
therefore the MME regards the sending of the NAS security transparent
container as the sending of an initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message in
order to derive and take into use a mapped EPS security context for the
purpose of the NAS COUNT handling.

In some NAS messages only 5 of the 8 NAS sequence number bits are
transmitted. When this is the case, the receiver shall estimate the
remaining 3 most significant bits of the sequence number.

4.4.3.2 Replay protection

Replay protection shall be supported for received NAS messages both in
the MME and the UE. However, since the realization of replay protection
does not affect the interoperability between nodes, no specific
mechanism is required for implementation.

Replay protection must assure that one and the same NAS message is not
accepted twice by the receiver. Specifically, for a given EPS security
context, a given NAS COUNT value shall be accepted at most one time and
only if message integrity verifies correctly.

Replay protection is not applicable when EIA0 is used.

4.4.3.3 Integrity protection and verification

The sender shall use its locally stored NAS COUNT as input to the
integrity protection algorithm.

The receiver shall use the NAS sequence number included in the received
message (or estimated from the 5 bits of the NAS sequence number
received in the message) and an estimate for the NAS overflow counter as
defined in clause 4.4.3.1 to form the NAS COUNT input to the integrity
verification algorithm.

The algorithm to calculate the integrity protection information is
specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], and the integrity protection shall
include octets 6 to n of the security protected NAS message, i.e. the
sequence number IE and the NAS message IE. The integrity protection of
the SERVICE REQUEST message is defined in clause 9.9.3.28. In addition
to the data that is to be integrity protected, the constant BEARER ID,
DIRECTION bit, NAS COUNT and NAS integrity key are input to the
integrity protection algorithm. These parameters are described in
3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

After successful integrity protection validation, the receiver shall
update its corresponding locally stored NAS COUNT with the value of the
estimated NAS COUNT for this NAS message.

Integrity verification is not applicable when EIA0 is used.

4.4.3.4 Ciphering and deciphering

The sender shall use its locally stored NAS COUNT as input to the
ciphering algorithm.

The receiver shall use the NAS sequence number included in the received
message (or estimated from the 5 bits of the NAS sequence number
received in the message) and an estimate for the NAS overflow counter as
defined in clause 4.4.3.1 to form the NAS COUNT input to the deciphering
algorithm.

The input parameters to the NAS ciphering algorithm are the constant
BEARER ID, DIRECTION bit, NAS COUNT, NAS encryption key and the length
of the key stream to be generated by the encryption algorithm. When an
initial plain NAS message for transport of user data via control plane
(i.e. CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message) is to be partially
ciphered, the length of the key stream is set to the length of the part
of the initial plain NAS message (i.e. the value part of the ESM message
container IE or the value part of the NAS message container) that is to
be ciphered.

4.4.3.5 NAS COUNT wrap around

If, when increasing the NAS COUNT as specified above, the MME detects
that either its downlink NAS COUNT or the UE's uplink NAS COUNT is
"close" to wrap around, (close to 2²⁴), the MME shall take the following
actions:

- If there is no non-current native EPS security context with
sufficiently low NAS COUNT values, the MME shall initiate a new AKA
procedure with the UE, leading to a new established EPS security context
and the NAS COUNT being reset to 0 in both the UE and the MME when the
new EPS security context is activated;

- Otherwise, the MME can activate a non-current native EPS security
context with sufficiently low NAS COUNT values or initiate a new AKA
procedure as specified above.

If for some reason a new K_(ASME) has not been established using AKA
before the NAS COUNT wraps around, the node (MME or UE) in need of
sending a NAS message shall instead release the NAS signalling
connection. Prior to sending the next uplink NAS message, the UE shall
delete the eKSI indicating the current EPS security context.

When the EIA0 is used as the NAS integrity algorithm, the UE and the MME
shall allow NAS COUNT wrap around. If NAS COUNT wrap around occurs, the
following requirements apply:

- the UE and the MME shall continue to use the current security context;

- the MME shall not initiate the EPS AKA procedure;

- the MME shall not release the NAS signalling connection; and

- the UE shall not perform a local release of the NAS signalling
connection.

4.4.4 Integrity protection of NAS signalling messages

4.4.4.1 General

For the UE, integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the NAS
messages once a valid EPS security context exists and has been taken
into use. For the network, integrity protected signalling is mandatory
for the NAS messages once a secure exchange of NAS messages has been
established for the NAS signalling connection. Integrity protection of
all NAS signalling messages is the responsibility of the NAS. It is the
network which activates integrity protection.

The use of "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 (see
clause 9.9.3.23) in the current security context is only allowed for an
unauthenticated UE for which establishment of emergency bearer services
or access to RLOS is allowed. For setting the security header type in
outbound NAS messages, the UE and the MME shall apply the same rules
irrespective of whether the "null integrity protection algorithm" or any
other integrity protection algorithm is indicated in the security
context.

If the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 has been selected as
an integrity protection algorithm, the receiver shall regard the NAS
messages with the security header indicating integrity protection as
integrity protected.

Details of the integrity protection and verification of NAS signalling
messages are specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

When a NAS message needs to be sent both ciphered and integrity
protected, the NAS message is first ciphered and then the ciphered NAS
message and the NAS sequence number are integrity protected by
calculating the MAC. The same applies when an initial NAS message needs
to be sent partially ciphered and integrity protected.

NOTE: NAS messages that are ciphered or partially ciphered with the
"null ciphering algorithm" EEA0 are regarded as ciphered or partially
ciphered, respectively (see clause 4.4.5).

When a NAS message needs to be sent only integrity protected and
unciphered, the unciphered NAS message and the NAS sequence number are
integrity protected by calculating the MAC.

When during the EPS attach procedure or service request procedure an ESM
message is piggybacked in an EMM message, there is only one sequence
number IE and one message authentication code IE, if any, for the
combined NAS message.

4.4.4.2 Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the UE

Except the messages listed below, no NAS signalling messages shall be
processed by the receiving EMM entity in the UE or forwarded to the ESM
entity, unless the network has established secure exchange of NAS
messages for the NAS signalling connection:

- EMM messages:

- IDENTITY REQUEST (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);

- AUTHENTICATION REQUEST;

- AUTHENTICATION REJECT;

- ATTACH REJECT (if the EMM cause is not #25 or #78);

- DETACH ACCEPT (for non switch off);

- TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT (if the EMM cause is not #25 or #78);

- SERVICE REJECT (if the EMM cause is not #25 or #78).

NOTE: These messages are accepted by the UE without integrity
protection, as in certain situations they are sent by the network before
security can be activated.

All ESM messages are integrity protected.

Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established, the
receiving EMM or ESM entity in the UE shall not process any NAS
signalling messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked
by the NAS. If NAS signalling messages, having not successfully passed
the integrity check, are received, then the NAS in the UE shall discard
that message. The processing of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that
has not successfully passed the integrity check is specified in
clause 5.4.3.5. If any NAS signalling message is received as not
integrity protected even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has
been established by the network, then the NAS shall discard this
message.

4.4.4.3 Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the MME

Except the messages listed below, no NAS signalling messages shall be
processed by the receiving EMM entity in the MME or forwarded to the ESM
entity, unless the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established
for the NAS signalling connection:

- EMM messages:

- ATTACH REQUEST;

- IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);

- AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE;

- AUTHENTICATION FAILURE;

- SECURITY MODE REJECT;

- DETACH REQUEST;

- DETACH ACCEPT;

- TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST.

NOTE 1: The TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is sent by the UE
without integrity protection, if the tracking area updating procedure is
initiated due to an inter-system change in idle mode and no current EPS
security context is available in the UE. The other messages are accepted
by the MME without integrity protection, as in certain situations they
are sent by the UE before security can be activated.

NOTE 2: The DETACH REQUEST message can be sent by the UE without
integrity protection, e.g. if the UE is attached for emergency bearer
services or access to RLOS and there is no shared EPS security context
available, or if due to user interaction an attach procedure is
cancelled before the secure exchange of NAS messages has been
established. For these cases the network can attempt to use additional
criteria (e.g. whether the UE is subsequently still performing periodic
tracking area updating or still responding to paging) before marking the
UE as EMM-DEREGISTERED.

All ESM messages are integrity protected except a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message if it is sent piggybacked in ATTACH REQUEST message and
NAS security is not activated.

Once a current EPS security context exists, until the secure exchange of
NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection, the
receiving EMM entity in the MME shall process the following NAS
signalling messages, even if the MAC included in the message fails the
integrity check or cannot be verified, as the EPS security context is
not available in the network:

- ATTACH REQUEST;

- IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);

- AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE;

- AUTHENTICATION FAILURE;

- SECURITY MODE REJECT;

- DETACH REQUEST;

- DETACH ACCEPT;

- TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST;

- SERVICE REQUEST;

- EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST;

- CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST.

NOTE 3: These messages are processed by the MME even when the MAC that
fails the integrity check or cannot be verified, as in certain
situations they can be sent by the UE protected with an EPS security
context that is no longer available in the network.

If an ATTACH REQUEST message is received without integrity protection or
fails the integrity check and it is not an attach request for emergency
bearer services and it is not an attach request for access to RLOS, the
MME shall authenticate the subscriber before processing the attach
request any further. Additionally, if the MME initiates a security mode
control procedure, the MME shall include a HASH_(MME) IE in the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message as specified in clause 5.4.3.2. If authentication
procedure is not successful the MME shall maintain, if any, the
EMM-context and EPS security context unchanged. For the case when the
attach procedure is for emergency bearer services see clause 5.5.1.2.3
and clause 5.4.2.5.

If a DETACH REQUEST message fails the integrity check, the MME shall
proceed as follows:

- If it is not a detach request due to switch off, and the MME can
initiate an authentication procedure, the MME should authenticate the
subscriber before processing the detach request any further.

- If it is a detach request due to switch off, or the MME does not
initiate an authentication procedure for any other reason, the MME may
ignore the detach request and remain in state EMM-REGISTERED.

NOTE 4: The network can attempt to use additional criteria (e.g. whether
the UE is subsequently still performing periodic tracking area updating
or still responding to paging) before marking the UE as
EMM-DEREGISTERED.

If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received without integrity
protection or fails the integrity check and the UE provided a
nonce_(UE), GPRS ciphering key sequence number, P-TMSI and RAI in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall initiate a security
mode control procedure to take a new mapped EPS security context into
use; otherwise, if the UE has only a PDN connection for non-emergency
bearer services established and the PDN connection is not for RLOS, the
MME shall initiate an authentication procedure. Additionally, if the MME
initiates a security mode control procedure, the MME shall include a
HASH_(MME) IE in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message as specified in
clause 5.4.3.2. If authentication procedure is not successful the MME
shall maintain, if any, the EMM-context and EPS security context
unchanged. For the case when the UE has a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services or for RLOS see clause 5.5.3.2.3 and clause 5.4.2.5.

If a SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message fails the integrity check and the UE has only PDN
connections for non-emergency bearer services established and the PDN
connections are not for RLOS, the MME shall send the SERVICE REJECT
message with EMM cause #9 "UE identity cannot be derived by the network"
and keep the EMM-context and EPS security context unchanged. For the
case when the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services or
RLOS and integrity check fails, the MME may skip the authentication
procedure even if no EPS security context is available and proceed
directly to the execution of the security mode control procedure as
specified in clause 5.4.3. After successful completion of the service
request procedure, the network shall deactivate all non-emergency EPS
bearers locally which are not EPS bearers for RLOS. The emergency EPS
bearers shall not be deactivated. The network may deactivate the EPS
bearers for RLOS.

Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the
NAS signalling connection, the receiving EMM or ESM entity in the MME
shall not process any NAS signalling messages unless they have been
successfully integrity checked by the NAS. If any NAS signalling
message, having not successfully passed the integrity check, is
received, then the NAS in the MME shall discard that message. If any NAS
signalling message is received, as not integrity protected even though
the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established, then the NAS
shall discard this message.

4.4.5 Ciphering of NAS signalling messages

The use of ciphering in a network is an operator option subject to MME
configuration. When operation of the network without ciphering is
configured, the MME shall indicate the use of "null ciphering algorithm"
EEA0 (see clause 9.9.3.23) in the current security context for all UEs.
For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages, the UE
and the MME shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether the "null
ciphering algorithm" or any other ciphering algorithm is indicated in
the security context.

When the UE establishes a new NAS signalling connection, it shall send
the initial NAS message

- partially ciphered, if it is a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
including an ESM message container information element or a NAS message
container information element; and

- unciphered, if it is any other initial NAS message.

The UE shall partially cipher the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
by ciphering the value part of the ESM message container IE or the value
part of the NAS message container, using the ciphering algorithm of the
current EPS security context.

The UE shall send the ATTACH REQUEST message always unciphered.

The UE shall send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message always
unciphered.

Except for the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message including an ESM
message container information element or a NAS message container
information element, the UE shall start the ciphering and deciphering of
NAS messages when the secure exchange of NAS messages has been
established for a NAS signalling connection. From this time onward,
unless explicitly defined, the UE shall send all NAS messages ciphered
until the NAS signalling connection is released, or the UE performs
intersystem handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

The MME shall start ciphering and deciphering of NAS messages as
described in clause 4.4.2.3. From this time onward, except for the
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the MME shall send all NAS messages
ciphered until the NAS signalling connection is released, or the UE
performs intersystem handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

Once the encryption of NAS messages has been started between the MME and
the UE, the receiver shall discard the unciphered NAS messages which
shall have been ciphered according to the rules described in this
specification. The MME shall discard any CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
message including an ESM message container information element or a NAS
message container information element which has not been partially
ciphered according to the rules described above.

If the "null ciphering algorithm" EEA0 has been selected as a ciphering
algorithm, the NAS messages with the security header indicating
ciphering are regarded as ciphered.

Details of ciphering and deciphering of NAS signalling messages are
specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

4.5 Disabling and re-enabling of UE's E-UTRA capability

The UE shall only disable the E-UTRA capability when in EMM-IDLE mode.

When the UE supports both N1 mode and S1 mode then the UE's capability
to access the 5GCN via E-UTRA shall not be affected, if the UE's E-UTRA
capability is disabled or enabled.

When the UE is disabling the E-UTRA capability not due to redirection to
5GCN required, it should proceed as follows:

a) select another RAT (GERAN, UTRAN, or NG-RAN if the UE has not
disabled its N1 mode capability for 3GPP access as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of
equivalent PLMNs;

b) if another RAT of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of
equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, or the UE does not have a registered
PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. As
an implementation option, instead of performing PLMN selection, the UE
may select another RAT of the chosen PLMN. If disabling of E-UTRA
capability was not due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services
only, the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability for this PLMN
selection; or

c) if no other allowed PLMN and RAT combinations are available, then the
UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability and remain registered for EPS
services in E-UTRAN of the registered PLMN. If the UE chooses this
option, then it may periodically attempt to select another PLMN and RAT
combination that can provide non-EPS services. How this periodic
scanning is done, is UE implementation dependent.

When the UE is disabling the E-UTRA capability upon receiving reject
cause #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required" as specified in
clauses 5.5.1.2.5, 5.5.1.3.5, 5.5.3.2.5, 5.5.3.3.5 and 5.6.1.5, it
should proceed as follows:

i) If the UE is in NB-S1 mode:

1) if lower layers do not provide an indication that the current E-UTRA
cell is connected to 5GCN or lower layers do not provide an indication
that the current E-UTRA cell supports CIoT 5GS optimizations that are
supported by the UE, search for a suitable NB-IoT cell connected to 5GCN
according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21];

2) if lower layers provide an indication that the current E-UTRA cell is
connected to 5GCN and the current E-UTRA cell supports CIoT 5GS
optimizations that are supported by the UE then perform a core network
selection to select 5GCN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
clause 4.8.4A.1; or

3) if lower layers cannot find a suitable NB-IoT cell connected to 5GCN
or there is no suitable NB-IoT cell connected to 5GCN which supports
CIoT 5GS optimizations that are supported by the UE, the UE, as an
implementation option, may indicate to lower layers to remain camped in
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, may then start an implementation-specific
timer and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE the UE may
re-enable the E-UTRA capability for 3GPP access at expiry of the
implementation-specific timer, if the timer had been started, and may
then, proceed with the appropriate EMM procedure.

ii) If the UE is in WB-S1 mode:

1) if lower layers do not provide an indication that the current E-UTRA
cell is connected to 5GCN or lower layers do not provide an indication
that the current E-UTRA cell supports CIoT 5GS optimizations that are
supported by the UE, search for a suitable E-UTRA cell connected to 5GCN
according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21];

2) if lower layers provide an indication that the current E-UTRA cell is
connected to 5GCN and the current E-UTRA cell supports CIoT 5GS
optimizations that are supported by the UE, then perform a core network
selection to select 5GCN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
clause 4.8.4A.1; or

3) if lower layers cannot find a suitable E-UTRA cell connected to 5GCN
or there is no suitable E-UTRA cell connected to 5GCN which supports
CIoT 5GS optimizations that are supported by the UE, the UE, as an
implementation option, may indicate to lower layers to remain camped in
E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, may then start an implementation-specific
timer and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE the UE may
re-enable the E-UTRA capability for 3GPP access at expiry of the
implementation-specific timer, if the timer had been started, and may
then, proceed with the appropriate EMM procedure.

The UE shall re-enable the E-UTRA capability when performing a PLMN
selection unless:

- the disabling of E-UTRA capability was due to UE initiated detach
procedure for EPS services only; or

- the UE has already re-enabled the E-UTRA capability when performing
bullets b) or c) above.

If due to handover, the UE moves to a new PLMN in A/Gb, Iu, or N1 mode
which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs and not a PLMN memorized by
the UE for which E-UTRA capability was disabled, and the disabling of
E-UTRA capability was not due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS
services only, the UE shall re-enable the E-UTRA capability after the
RR/RRC connection is released.

If UE that has disabled its E-UTRA capability due to IMS voice not
available and CS fallback not available re-enables it when PLMN
selection is performed, then it should memorize the identity of the
PLMNs where E-UTRA capability was disabled and use that stored
information in subsequent PLMN selections as specified in
3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

The UE may support "E-UTRA Disabling for EMM cause #15" and implement
the following behaviour:

- if the "E-UTRA Disabling Allowed for EMM cause #15" parameter as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17] is present and
set to enabled; and

- if the UE receives an ATTACH REJECT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT
message including both EMM cause #15 "no suitable cells in tracking
area" and an Extended EMM cause IE with value "E-UTRAN not allowed";

then the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability, memorize the identity
of the PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled and use that stored
information in subsequent PLMN selections as specified in
3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

When the UE supporting the A/Gb and/or Iu mode together with the S1 mode
needs to stay in A/Gb or Iu mode, in order to prevent unwanted handover
or cell reselection from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, the UE shall disable
the E-UTRA capability and:

- The UE shall not set the E-UTRA support bits of the MS Radio Access
capability IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], clause 10.5.5.12a), the E-UTRA
support bits of Mobile Station Classmark 3 IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13],
clause 10.5.1.7), the PS inter-RAT HO from GERAN to E-UTRAN S1 mode
capability bit and the ISR support bit of the MS network capability IE
(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], clause 10.5.5.12) in the ATTACH REQUEST
message and the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message after it selects
GERAN or UTRAN;

- the UE shall use the same value of the EPC capability bit of the MS
network capability IE (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], clause 10.5.5.12) in the
ATTACH REQUEST message and the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message; and

- the UE NAS layer shall indicate the access stratum layer(s) of
disabling of the E-UTRA capability.

When the UE supporting N1 mode together with S1 mode needs to stay in N1
mode, in order to prevent unwanted handover or cell reselection from
NG-RAN to E-UTRAN, the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability and:

- the UE shall set the S1 mode bit to "S1 mode not supported" in the
5GMM Capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message (see
3GPP TS 24.501 [54]);

- the UE shall not include the S1 UE network capability IE in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]); and

- the UE NAS layer shall indicate the access stratum layer(s) of
disabling of the E-UTRA capability.

If the UE is disabling its E-UTRA capability before selecting to GERAN,
UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access technology, the UE shall not perform the
detach procedure of clause 5.5.2.1.

If the UE is required to disable the E-UTRA capability and select GERAN,
UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access technology, and the UE is in the
EMM-CONNECTED mode:

- if the UE has a persistent EPS bearer context and the ongoing
procedure is not a detach procedure, then the UE shall wait until the
radio bearer associated with the persistent EPS bearer context has been
released;

- otherwise, the UE shall locally release the established NAS signalling
connection and enter the EMM-IDLE mode before selecting GERAN, UTRAN or
NG-RAN radio access technology.

If the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the attempt to select GERAN
or UTRAN radio access technology progressing the CS emergency call
establishment (see clause 4.3.1), the criteria to enable the E-UTRA
capability again is UE implementation specific.

If the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the UE initiated detach
procedure for EPS services only (see clause 5.5.2.2.2), upon request of
the upper layers to re-attach for EPS services the UE shall enable the
E-UTRA capability again. If the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to
receipt of EMM cause #14 "EPS services not allowed in this PLMN", then
the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability when the UE powers off and
powers on again or the USIM is removed. If E-UTRA capability was
disabled for any other reason, the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability
in the following cases:

- the UE mode of operation changes from CS/PS mode 1 of operation to
CS/PS mode 2 of operation;

- the UE mode of operation changes from PS mode 1 of operation to PS
mode 2 of operation; or

- the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed;

As an implementation option, the UE may start a timer for enabling
E-UTRA when the UE's attach attempt counter or tracking area updating
attempt counter reaches 5 and the UE disables E-UTRA capability for
cases described in clauses 5.5.1.2.6, 5.5.1.3.4.3, 5.5.1.3.6, 5.5.3.2.6,
5.5.3.3.4.3 and 5.5.3.3.6. The UE should memorize the identity of the
PLMNs where E-UTRA capability was disabled. On expiry of this timer:

- if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and is in idle mode as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], the UE should enable the E-UTRA capability;

- if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and an RR connection exists, the
UE shall delay enabling E-UTRA capability until the RR connection is
released;

- if the UE is in Iu mode and a PS signalling connection exists but no
RR connection exists, the UE may abort the PS signalling connection
before enabling E-UTRA capability; or

- if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-IDLE mode as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54], the UE should enable the E-UTRA capability; and

- if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54], the UE shall delay enabling the E-UTRA capability
until the N1 NAS signalling connection is released.

When the UE enables E-UTRA capability, the UE shall delete the PLMN from
the memorized identity of the PLMNs where E-UTRA capability was
disabled.

NOTE 1: As described 3GPP TS 23.122 [6], if the UE is in automatic PLMN
selection mode, the UE does not consider the memorized PLMNs as PLMN
selection candidates for E-UTRA access technology till the timer
expires.

If the UE attempts to establish an emergency bearer service or to access
RLOS in a PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the UE's
attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter have
reached 5, the UE may enable the E-UTRA capability for that PLMN
memorized by the UE.

The UE may support being configured for No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS (see
3GPP TS 24.368 [50] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]). If the UE supports being
configured for No E-UTRA Disabling in 5GS, No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is
enabled if the corresponding configuration parameter is present and set
to enabled. Otherwise, No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is disabled. If No
E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the UE and the UE selects an
NG-RAN cell in a PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to
the UE's attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt
counter having reached 5, the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability for
that PLMN.

For other cases, it is up to the UE implementation when to enable the
E-UTRA capability.

NOTE 2: If the UE is not operating in CS/PS mode 1 operation, the value
of the timer for enabling E-UTRA capability is recommended to be not
larger than the default value of T3402.

4.6 Applicability of procedures

4.6.1 Relay nodes

A relay node shall support all procedures that are mandatory for a UE
supporting S1 mode only.

There is also functionality which is only applicable to a relay node, in
which case the specification uses the term "relay node" instead of "UE".

4.7 EPS mobility management and EPS session management in NB-S1 mode

A UE in NB-S1 mode (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) shall calculate the value
of the applicable NAS timer:

- indicated in table 10.2.1 plus 240s; and

- indicated in table 10.3.1 plus 180s.

The timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate
procedure clause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be
calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not re-calculate the
use of the NAS timer value until the NAS procedure is completed,
restarted or aborted.

When an MME that supports NB-S1 mode performs NAS signalling with a UE,
which is using NB-S1 mode, the MME shall calculate the value of the
applicable NAS timer:

- indicated in table 10.2.2 plus 240s; and

- indicated in table 10.3.2 plus 180s.

The timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate
procedure clause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be
calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not re-calculate the
use of the NAS timer value until the NAS procedure is completed,
restarted or aborted.

NOTE 1: If the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in
EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME can stop any running implementation specific
supervision timer if it is started when sending an ESM DATA TRANSPORT
message to the UE.

NOTE 2: As NB-S1 mode includes the case when satellite access is used in
EPS, the values for applicable NAS timers specified in this clause apply
also for satellite access.

4.8 EPS mobility management and EPS session management in WB-S1 mode for IoT

4.8.1 UE not using satellite E-UTRAN access

In WB-S1 mode, a UE operating in category CE can operate in either CE
mode A or CE mode B (see 3GPP TS 36.306 [44]). If a UE that supports CE
mode B and operates in WB-S1 mode not using satellite E-UTRAN access,
the UE's usage setting is not set to "voice centric" (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]), and

a) the use of enhanced coverage is not restricted for the UE; or

b) CE mode B is not restricted for the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]);

the UE shall apply the value of the applicable NAS timer indicated in
tables 10.2.1 and indicated in table 10.3.1 for WB-S1/CE mode.

A UE that supports CE mode B and operates in WB-S1 mode not using
satellite E-UTRAN access shall not apply the value of the applicable NAS
timer indicated in table 10.2.1 and table 10.3.1 for WB-S1/CE mode
before receiving an indication from the network that the use of enhanced
coverage is not restricted as described in this clause.

The NAS timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate
procedure clause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be
calculated at start of a NAS procedure, and shall not be re-calculated
until the NAS procedure is completed, restarted or aborted.

The support of CE mode B by a UE is indicated to the MME by lower layers
and shall be stored by the MME. When an MME that supports WB-S1 mode
performs NAS signalling with a UE not using satellite E-UTRAN access,
which supports CE mode B and operates in WB-S1 mode and the MME
determines that:

a) the use of enhanced coverage is not restricted for the UE; or

b) CE mode B is not restricted for the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]);

the MME shall calculate the value of the applicable NAS timer indicated
in tables 10.2.2 and indicated in table 10.3.2 for WB-S1/CE mode.

The NAS timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate
procedure clause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be
calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be re-calculated
until the NAS procedure is completed, restarted or aborted.

4.8.2 UE using satellite E-UTRAN access

In WB-S1 mode via satellite E-UTRAN access, the UE shall apply the value
of the applicable NAS timer indicated in tables 10.2.1 and indicated in
table 10.3.1 for WB-S1/CE mode.

The NAS timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate
procedure clause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be
calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be re-calculated
until the NAS procedure is completed, restarted or aborted.

When an MME that supports WB-S1 mode performs NAS signalling with a UE
via satellite E-UTRAN access, the MME shall calculate the value of the
applicable NAS timer indicated in tables 10.2.2 and indicated in table
10.3.2 for WB-S1/CE mode.

The NAS timer value obtained is used as described in the appropriate
procedure clause of this specification. The NAS timer value shall be
calculated at start of a NAS procedure and shall not be re-calculated
until the NAS procedure is completed, restarted or aborted.

NOTE: When using satellite E-UTRAN access, the restriction on use of
enhanced coverage indication from the network is not considered when
applicable NAS timers are determined.

4.9 Disabling and re-enabling of UE's NB-IoT capability

If the UE supports disabling and re-enabling of UE's NB-IoT capability
and the UE in NB-S1 mode is disabling the NB-IoT capability, it should
proceed as follows:

a) select E-UTRAN, or for the UE which supports CIoT EPS optimization
select satellite E-UTRAN via "WB-E-UTRAN(LEO)", "WB-E-UTRAN(MEO)", or
"WB-E-UTRAN(GEO)", of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of
equivalent PLMNs;

b) if E-UTRAN, or for the UE which supports CIoT EPS optimization if
satellite E-UTRAN via "WB-E-UTRAN(LEO)", "WB-E-UTRAN(MEO)", or
"WB-E-UTRAN(GEO)", of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of
equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, select another RAT (GERAN, UTRAN, or
NG-RAN if the UE has not disabled its N1 mode capability for 3GPP access
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) of the registered PLMN or a PLMN
from the list of equivalent PLMNs;

c) if another RAT of the registered PLMN or a PLMN from the list of
equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, or the UE does not have a registered
PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. As
an implementation option, instead of performing PLMN selection, the UE
may select another RAT of the chosen PLMN; or

d) if no other allowed PLMN and RAT combinations are available, then the
UE may re-enable the NB-IoT capability and remain registered for EPS
services in NB-IoT of the registered PLMN. If the UE chooses this
option, then it may periodically attempt to select another PLMN and RAT
combination that can provide non-EPS services. How this periodic
scanning is done, is UE implementation dependent.

If the NB-IoT capability is disabled, the UE shall re-enable the NB-IoT
capability when:

- performing a PLMN selection unless the UE has already re-enabled the
NB-IoT capability when performing bullet c) or d) above; or

- the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed.

If the UE in NB-S1 mode receives an ATTACH REJECT or TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REJECT message including both EMM cause #15 "no suitable cells in
tracking area" and an Extended EMM cause IE with value "NB-IoT not
allowed" after the UE requests access to the NB-IoT, in order to prevent
unwanted cell reselection from GERAN, UTRAN, E-UTRAN or NG-RAN to
NB-IoT, the UE may:

- disable the NB-IoT capability:

- indicate the access stratum layer(s) of disabling of the NB-IoT
capability; and

- memorize the identity of the PLMN where the NB-IoT capability was
disabled and use that stored information in subsequent PLMN selections
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

NOTE: The UE can only disable the NB-IoT capability when in EMM-IDLE
mode.

If the UE in NB-S1 mode is required to disable the NB-IoT capability and
select E-UTRAN radio access technology, and the UE is in the
EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE shall locally release the established NAS
signalling connection and enter the EMM-IDLE mode before selecting
E-UTRAN radio access technology.

As an implementation option, the UE may start a timer for enabling the
NB-IoT capability. On expiry of this timer, the UE may enable the NB-IoT
capability.

4.10 Support of MUSIM features

A network and a MUSIM UE may support one or more of the MUSIM features
(i.e. the NAS signalling connection release, the paging indication for
voice services, the reject paging request, the paging restriction and
the paging timing collision control).

If MUSIM UE supports one or more MUSIM features, the UE indicates
support of one or more MUSIM features during the attach procedure and
the normal tracking area updating procedure. If the UE has indicated
support of the NAS signalling connection release or the reject paging
request or both and the UE supports the paging restriction, the UE
indicates support of the paging restriction.

If the UE indicates support of one or more MUSIM features and the
network decides to accept one or more MUSIM features, the network
indicates the support of one or more MUSIM features during the attach
procedure and the normal tracking area updating procedure. The network
only indicates the support of the paging restriction together with the
support of either NAS signalling connection release or the reject paging
request.

The network does not indicate support for any MUSIM feature to the UE
during the attach for emergency bearer services.

If a UE stops fulfilling the condition to be considered a MUSIM UE as
defined in subclause 3.1, and the UE has negotiated support of one or
more MUSIM features, then the UE shall initiate a normal tracking area
update procedure to indicate that all the MUSIM features are not
supported as specified in clause 5.5.3.2.

A MUSIM UE operating in NB-S1 mode or in WB-S1 mode CE mode B does not
indicate the support for paging indication for voice services during the
attach procedure or the normal tracking area update procedure towards
the network.

4.11 Satellite access for CIoT

4.11.1 General

The UE and the network may support a satellite E-UTRAN access in WB-S1
mode or NB-S1 mode with CIoT EPS optimization. Support for satellite
E-UTRAN access is specified in 3GPP TS 36.300 [20].

An MME can determine a UE is accessing the network using a satellite
E-UTRAN access and may enforce mobility restriction for the UE as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

If unavailability period is activated due to discontinuous coverage (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]), all NAS timers are stopped and associated
procedures aborted except for T3412, T3346, T3396, T3447, T3448, any
backoff timers, T3245, T3247, the timer T controlling the periodic
search for HPLMN or EHPLMN (if EHPLMN list is present) or higher
prioritized PLMNs, and the timer T_(SENSE) controlling the periodic
search for PLMNs satisfying the operator controlled signal level
threshold (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]) and the UE may deactivate access
stratum.

4.11.2 Handling list of "PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location"

The UE may be rejected with EMM cause #78 in ATTACH REJECT message,
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message or DETACH REQUEST message. The EMM
cause #78 is applicable for the UE only when the UE is accessing a PLMN
using a satellite E-UTRAN access.

For the satellite E-UTRAN access the UE shall store a list of "PLMN not
allowed to operate at the present UE location". Each entry in the list
consists of:

a) PLMN identity of the PLMN which sent a message including EMM cause
value #78 "PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location" via
the satellite E-UTRAN access technology;

b) geographical location, if known by the UE, where the EMM cause value
#78 was received over the satellite E-UTRAN access technology; and

c) if the geographical location exists, a UE implementation specific
distance value.

Before storing a new entry in the list, the UE shall delete any existing
entry with the same PLMN identity. Upon storing a new entry, the UE
starts a timer instance associated with the entry with an implementation
specific value that shall not be set to a value smaller than the timer
value indicated by the network in the Lower bound timer value IE, if
any. If the Lower bound timer value IE was not provided by the network,
the value of the timer shall be set based on the UE implementation. An
entry in the list is deleted if the timer associated to the entry
expires or the UE successfully registers to the PLMN stored in the
entry.

The UE is allowed to attempt to access a PLMN via the satellite E-UTRAN
access technology which is part of the list of "PLMNs not allowed to
operate at the present UE location" if:

a) the current UE location is known, a geographical location is stored
for the entry of this PLMN, and the distance from location where EMM
cause value #78 was received to the current UE location is larger than a
UE implementation specific value; or

b) the access is for emergency services (see 3GPP TS 23.122 [5] for
further details).

NOTE: When the UE is accessing network for emergency services, it is up
to operator and regulatory policies whether the network needs to
determine if the UE is in a location where network is not allowed to
operate.

The list shall accommodate three or more entries. The maximum number of
entries is an implementation decision. When the list is full and a new
entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry shall be deleted.

Each entry shall be removed if for the entry:

a) the UE successfully registers via the satellite E-UTRAN access
technology to the PLMN stored in the entry except when the UE is
attached for emergency bearer services; or

b) the timer instance associated with the entry expires.

The UE may remove an entry in the list, if the UE's current location is
known, a geographical is stored for the entry of this PLMN, and the
distance from location where EMM cause value #78 was received to the
current UE location is larger than the UE implementation specific value.

If the UE is in EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE state and an entry from
the list of "PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location" is
removed, the UE shall perform PLMN selection according to
3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

When the UE is switched off, the UE shall keep the list of "PLMNs not
allowed to operate at the present UE location" in its non-volatile
memory together with the SUPI from the USIM. The UE shall delete the
list of "PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location" if the
USIM is removed.

If the UE is switched off when the timer instance associated with the
entry in the list is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE
is switched on and the USIM in the UE remains the same:

let t1 be the time remaining for timer instance associated with the
entry in the list to timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed
between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater than t, then the
timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1 is equal to or
less than t, then the timer need not be restarted and considered
expired. If the UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall
restart the timer with the value t1.

4.11.3 Handling multiple tracking area codes from the lower layers

When a UE camps on a satellite E-UTRAN cell, the UE may receive multiple
TACs from the lower layers. The UE shall construct TAIs from the
multiple TACs (i.e. concatenate the identity of the current PLMN and
each of the TACs) and select a TAI as follows:

a) if at least one TAI belongs to the TAI list of the UE, the UE shall
select a TAI which belongs to the TAI list. If there are multiple TAIs
which belong to the TAI list the UE shall consider each of these TAIs
equal and:

- if the UE can determine a TAI which represents the best the tracking
area of the UE's geographical location, the UE shall select a TAI which
represents the best the tracking area of the UE's geographical location;
and

- otherwise, the UE shall select a TAI in an implementation-specific
way.

b) if no TAI belongs to the TAI list of the UE and:

1) there is a TAI which belongs to neither the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming" nor the list of "forbidden tracking areas
for regional provision of service", the UE shall select a TAI which
belongs to neither the list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming"
nor the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service". In this case, if there are multiple TAIs which belong to
neither the list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" nor the list
of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service", then
the UE shall consider each of these TAIs equal and:

- if the UE can determine a TAI which represents the best the tracking
area of the UE's geographical location, the UE shall select a TAI which
represents the best the tracking area of the UE's geographical location;
and

- otherwise, the UE shall select a TAI in an implementation-specific
way.

2) all TAIs belong to the list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming"
or the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service", then the UE shall consider each of these TAIs equal and:

- if the UE can determine a TAI which represents the best the tracking
area of the UE's geographical location, the UE shall select a TAI which
represents the best the tracking area of the UE's geographical location;
and

- otherwise, the UE shall select a TAI in an implementation-specific
way.

The UE shall consider the selected TAI as the current TAI. The UE shall
select a TAI as described above when:

a) the UE receives multiple TACs from the lower layers; or

b) the UE has received multiple TACs from the lower layers upon starting
to camping on the current cell and the TAI list, the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming", or the list of "forbidden tracking areas
for regional provision of service" is updated.

Handling of the list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" and the
list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service" is
specified in clause 5.3.2.

4.11.4 Support for enhanced discontinuous coverage 

If the UE and network support enhanced discontinuous coverage, the UE
may provide unavailability information to the network in the tracking
area updating procedure if the UE is registered over satellite E-UTRAN
access (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). The unavailability information
includes the unavailability period duration if known, and the start of
the unavailability period if known. The support for the enhanced
discontinuous coverage is negotiated in the attach procedure or the
tracking area updating procedure. The MME may consider the
unavailability period duration if provided by the UE to determine the
unavailability period duration of the UE. The MME may provide the
unavailability period duration to the UE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message. The MME may consider the unavailability period duration
if provided by the UE to determine the unavailability period duration of
the UE.

If the UE provided unavailability information in the last tracking area
updating procedure, the MME considers the UE unreachable until the UE
registers for normal service without providing unavailability
information. If the UE did not include a start of the unavailability
period, the MME shall consider the start of the unavailability period to
be the time at which MME received the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message to the UE. The MME may determine the value of the periodic
tracking area update timer (T3412) provided to the UE based on the
unavailability period duration and the start of the unavailability
period, if available. The MME releases the NAS signalling connection
after the completion of the attach procedure or the tracking area
updating procedure in which the UE provided unavailability information.

If for discontinuous coverage the UE has stored a discontinuous coverage
maximum time offset, upon returning in coverage after being out of
coverage due to discontinuous coverage, the UE sets the discontinuous
coverage maximum time offset value to a random value up to and including
the stored discontinuous coverage maximum time offset for this PLMN and
satellite E-UTRAN access and starts this timer. The UE shall not
initiate any NAS signalling on that satellite E-UTRAN access and PLMN
combination while the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer
is running. The UE shall stop the discontinuous coverage maximum time
offset timer and initiate NAS signalling if the UE receives a paging
message, has pending emergency services, is establishing an emergency
PDN connection, is performing emergency services fallback procedure or
when the UE enters a new tracking area.

When the unavailability period is activated, all NAS timers are stopped
and associated procedures aborted except for timers T3412, T3346, T3447,
T3396, any back-off timers, T3247, and the timer T controlling the
periodic search for HPLMN or EHPLMN or higher prioritized PLMNs (see
3GPP TS 23.122 [6]).

When the UE provides unavailability information using the tracking area
updating procedure without providing the start of the unavailability
period, then after successful completion of the procedure the UE may
deactivate the access stratum and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE. Otherwise, if the UE provided the
start of unavailability period, the UE may deactivate the access stratum
and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE only after the
start of the unavailability period.

5 Elementary procedures for EPS mobility management

5.1 Overview

5.1.1 General

This clause describes the procedures used for mobility management for
EPS services (EMM) at the radio interface (reference point "LTE-Uu").

The main function of the mobility management sublayer is to support the
mobility of a user equipment, such as informing the network of its
present location and providing user identity confidentiality.

A further function of the mobility management sublayer is to provide
connection management services to the session management (SM) sublayer
and the short message services (SMS) entity of the connection management
(CM) sublayer.

All the EMM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if
a NAS signalling connection has been established between the UE and the
network. Else, the EMM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a
NAS signalling connection (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

NOTE: In a satellite E-UTRAN access, a GNSS fix time in lower layers can
delay transmission of an initial UL NAS message by up to 100 seconds
(GNSS cold state).

5.1.2 Types of EMM procedures

Depending on how they can be initiated, three types of EMM procedures
can be distinguished:

1) EMM common procedures:

An EMM common procedure can always be initiated whilst a NAS signalling
connection exists. The procedures belonging to this type are:

Initiated by the network:

- GUTI reallocation;

- authentication;

- security mode control;

- identification;

- EMM information.

2) EMM specific procedures:

At any time only one UE initiated EMM specific procedure can be running.
The procedures belonging to this type are:

Initiated by the UE and used to attach the IMSI in the network for EPS
services and/or non-EPS services, and to establish an EMM context and if
requested by the UE, a default bearer:

- attach and combined attach.

Initiated by the UE and used to attach the IMSI or IMEI for emergency
bearer services, and to establish an EMM context and a default bearer to
a PDN that provides emergency bearer services:

- attach.

Initiated by the UE and used to attach the IMSI or IMEI for access to
RLOS, and to establish an EMM context and a default bearer to a PDN
connection for RLOS:

- attach.

Initiated by the UE or the network and used to detach the IMSI in the
network for EPS services and/or non-EPS services and to release an EMM
context and all bearers, if any:

- detach and combined detach.

Initiated by the UE and used to detach the IMSI in the network for EPS
services or non-EPS services and to release an EMM context and all
bearers, if any:

- eCall inactivity procedure.

Initiated by the UE when an EMM context has been established:

- normal tracking area updating and combined tracking area updating (S1
mode only);

- periodic tracking area updating (S1 mode only).

The tracking area updating procedure can be used to request also the
resource reservation for sending data.

3) EMM connection management procedures (S1 mode only):

Initiated by the UE and used to establish a secure connection to the
network or to request the resource reservation for sending data, or
both:

- service request.

The service request procedure can only be initiated if no UE initiated
EMM specific procedure is ongoing.

Initiated by the network and used to request the establishment of a NAS
signalling connection or to prompt the UE to re-attach if necessary as a
result of a network failure:

- paging procedure.

Initiated by the UE or the network and used to transport NAS messages:

- transport of NAS messages;

- generic transport of NAS messages.

The transport of NAS messages procedure and the generic transport of NAS
messages procedure cannot be initiated while an EMM specific procedure
or a service request procedure is ongoing.

5.1.3 EMM sublayer states

5.1.3.1 General

In the following clauses, the EMM protocol of the UE and the network is
described by means of two different state machines. In clause 5.1.3.2,
the states of the EMM entity in the UE are introduced. The behaviour of
the UE depends on an EPS update status that is described in
clause 5.1.3.3. The states for the MME side are described in
clause 5.1.3.4.

5.1.3.2 EMM sublayer states in the UE

5.1.3.2.1 General

In the following clauses, the possible EMM states of an EMM entity in
the UE are described. Clause 5.1.3.2.2 summarizes the main states of an
EMM entity. The substates that have been defined are described in
clause 5.1.3.2.3 and clause 5.1.3.2.4.

It should be noted, however, that this clause does not include a
description of the detailed behaviour of the UE in the single states and
does not cover abnormal cases. A detailed description of the behaviour
of the UE is given in clause 5.2. For the behaviour of the UE in
abnormal cases refer to the description of the elementary EMM procedures
in clauses 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7.

5.1.3.2.2 Main states

5.1.3.2.2.1 EMM-NULL

EPS services are disabled in the UE. No EPS mobility management function
shall be performed in this state.

5.1.3.2.2.2 EMM-DEREGISTERED

In the state EMM-DEREGISTERED, no EMM context has been established and
the UE location is unknown to an MME and hence it is unreachable by an
MME. In order to establish an EMM context, the UE shall start the attach
or combined attach procedure (see clause 5.5.1).

5.1.3.2.2.3 EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED

A UE enters the state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED after it has started the
attach or the combined attach procedure and is waiting for a response
from the MME (see clause 5.5.1).

5.1.3.2.2.4 EMM-REGISTERED

In the state EMM-REGISTERED an EMM context has been established.
Additionally a default EPS bearer context has been activated in the UE:

- if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or
the MME; or

- if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and
the MME, the UE has requested connectivity to a PDN and a default EPS
bearer context is successfully established.

When the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE location is known to the MME
with an accuracy of a list of tracking areas containing a certain number
of tracking areas. When the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE location
is known to the MME with an accuracy of a serving eNodeB. The UE may
initiate sending and receiving user data and signalling information and
reply to paging. Additionally, tracking area updating or combined
tracking area updating procedure is performed (see clause 5.5.3).

5.1.3.2.2.5 EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED

A UE enters the state EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED after it has requested
release of the EMM context by starting the detach or combined detach
procedure and is waiting for a response from the MME (see clause 5.5.2).

5.1.3.2.2.6 EMM-TRACKING-AREA-UPDATING-INITIATED

A UE enters the state EMM-TRACKING-AREA-UPDATING-INITIATED after it has
started the tracking area updating or combined tracking area updating
procedure and is waiting for a response from the MME (see clause 5.5.3).

5.1.3.2.2.7 EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED

A UE enters the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED after it has started
the service request procedure and is waiting for a response from the MME
(see clause 5.6.1).

[]

NOTE: Not all possible transitions are shown in this figure.

Figure 5.1.3.2.2.7.1: EMM main states in the UE

5.1.3.2.3 Substates of state EMM-DEREGISTERED

5.1.3.2.3.1 General

The state EMM-DEREGISTERED is subdivided into a number of substates as
described in this clause. Valid subscriber data are available for the UE
before it enters the substates, except for the substate
EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI.

5.1.3.2.3.2 EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE is chosen in the UE when a
suitable cell has been found and the PLMN or tracking area is not in the
forbidden list.

5.1.3.2.3.3 EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE is chosen in the UE, when
it is known that a selected cell is unable to provide normal service
(e.g. the selected cell is in a forbidden PLMN, is in a forbidden
tracking area or the selected cell is a CSG cell whose CSG ID and
associated PLMN identity are not included in the UE's Allowed CSG list
or in the UE's Operator CSG List).

5.1.3.2.3.4 EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH is chosen in the UE
if the attach or combined attach procedure failed due to a missing
response from the network or due to the circumstances described in
clauses 5.5.1.2.5, 5.5.1.2.6, 5.5.1.3.5 and 5.5.2.3.4.

5.1.3.2.3.5 EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH is chosen in the UE, if the UE
is searching for PLMNs. This substate is left either when a cell has
been selected (the new substate is NORMAL-SERVICE or LIMITED-SERVICE) or
when it has been concluded that no cell is available at the moment (the
new substate is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE).

5.1.3.2.3.6 EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI is chosen in the UE, if the UE has
no valid subscriber data available (SIM/USIM not available, or the
SIM/USIM is considered invalid by the UE) and a cell has been selected.

5.1.3.2.3.7 EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTACH-NEEDED

Valid subscriber data are available for the UE and for some reason an
attach must be performed as soon as possible. This substate can be
entered if the access class is blocked due to access class control, or
if the network rejects the NAS signalling connection establishment.

5.1.3.2.3.8 EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE

No E-UTRAN cell can be selected. This substate is entered either after a
first intensive search failed when in substate
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH or while the access stratum is de-activated
due to discontinuous coverage (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). Cells are
searched for at a low rhythm. No EPS services are offered.

5.1.3.2.3.9 EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE

The substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE is chosen in the UE when:

- the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17];

- timer T3444 and timer T3445 have expired or are not running;

- a PLMN has been selected as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6];

- the UE does not need to perform an eCall over IMS; and

- the UE does not need to perform a call to a non-emergency MSISDN or
URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service.

In this substate, the UE shall not initiate any signalling towards the
network, except to originate an eCall over IMS, or a call to a
non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal reconfiguration
service.

5.1.3.2.4 Substates of state EMM-REGISTERED

5.1.3.2.4.1 General

The state EMM-REGISTERED is subdivided into a number of substates as
described in this clause.

5.1.3.2.4.2 EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE

The substate EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE is chosen by the UE as the
primary substate when the UE enters the state EMM-REGISTERED.

5.1.3.2.4.3 EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE

The substate EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE is chosen by the UE if
the tracking area updating or combined tracking area updating procedure
failed due to a missing response from the network or due to the
circumstances described in clauses 5.3.9, 5.5.3.2.5, 5.5.3.2.6,
5.5.3.3.5, 5.6.1.5 and 5.6.1.6. No EMM procedure except the tracking
area updating or combined tracking area updating procedure shall be
initiated by the UE in this substate. No data shall be sent or received.

5.1.3.2.4.4 EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE

The substate EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE is chosen in the UE, if the
cell the UE selected is known not to be able to provide normal service.

5.1.3.2.4.5 EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH

The substate EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH is chosen in the UE, while the
UE is searching for PLMNs.

5.1.3.2.4.6 EMM-REGISTERED.UPDATE-NEEDED

The UE has to perform a tracking area updating or combined tracking area
updating procedure, but access to the current cell is barred. This state
can be entered if the access class is blocked due to access class
control, or if the network rejects the NAS signalling connection
establishment.

No EMM procedure except:

- tracking area updating;

- combined tracking area updating; or

- service request as a response to paging

shall be initiated by the UE in this substate.

5.1.3.2.4.7 EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE

E-UTRAN coverage has been lost, PSM is active in the UE or the access
stratum is de-activated due to discontinuous coverage (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). If PSM is active, the UE can deactivate PSM at any
time by activating the AS layer when the UE needs to send mobile
originated signalling or user data. Otherwise, the UE shall not initiate
any EMM procedure except for cell and PLMN reselection.

5.1.3.2.4.8 EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM

A combined attach procedure or a combined tracking area updating
procedure was successful for EPS services only. User data and signalling
information may be sent and received.

5.1.3.2.4.9 EMM-REGISTERED.IMSI-DETACH-INITIATED

The UE performs a combined detach procedure for non-EPS services only
(detach type "IMSI detach"). This substate is entered if the UE is
attached for EPS and non-EPS services and wants to detach for non-EPS
services only. User data and signalling information may be sent and
received.

5.1.3.3 EPS update status

In order to describe the detailed UE behaviour, the EPS update (EU)
status pertaining to a specific subscriber is defined.

The EPS update status is stored in a non-volatile memory in the USIM if
the corresponding file is present in the USIM, else in the non-volatile
memory in the ME, as described in annex C.

The EPS update status value is changed only after the execution of an
attach or combined attach, network initiated detach, authentication,
tracking area update or combined tracking area update, service request
or paging for EPS services using IMSI procedure or due to change in TAI
which is not part of TAI list while timer T3346 is running.

EU1: UPDATED

The last attach or tracking area updating attempt was successful.

EU2: NOT UPDATED

The last attach, service request or tracking area updating attempt
failed procedurally, e.g. no response or reject message was received
from the MME.

EU3: ROAMING NOT ALLOWED

The last attach, service request or tracking area updating attempt was
correctly performed, but the answer from the MME was negative (because
of roaming or subscription restrictions).

5.1.3.4 EMM sublayer states in the MME

5.1.3.4.1 EMM-DEREGISTERED

In the state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the MME has no EMM context or the EMM
Context is marked as detached. The UE is detached. The MME may answer to
an attach or a combined attach procedure initiated by the UE (see
clause 5.5.1). The MME may also answer to a tracking area updating
procedure or combined tracking area updating procedure initiated by a UE
if the EMM context is marked as detached. The MME may also answer to a
detach procedure initiated by the UE (see clause 5.5.1.2.7).

If ISR is not activated or ISR is deactivated during a routing area
updating or combined routing area updating procedure or an inter-system
handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode, the MME enters the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED after the successful completion of the procedure.

5.1.3.4.2 EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED

The MME enters the state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED, after it has
started a common EMM procedure (see clause 5.4) and is waiting for a
response from the UE.

5.1.3.4.3 EMM-REGISTERED

In the state EMM-REGISTERED, an EMM context has been established.
Additionally a default EPS bearer context has been activated in the MME:

- if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or
the MME; or

- if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and
the MME, the UE has requested connectivity to a PDN and a default EPS
bearer context is successfully established.

5.1.3.4.4 EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED

The MME enters the state EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED after it has started
a detach procedure and is waiting for a response from the UE (see
clause 5.5.2).

Figure 5.1.3.4.4.1: EMM main states in the MME

5.1.4 Coordination between EMM and GMM

If GMM and EMM are both enabled, a UE capable of S1 mode and A/Gb mode
or Iu mode or both shall maintain one common registration for GMM and
EMM indicating whether the UE is registered for packet services or not.

A UE that is not registered shall be in state GMM-DEREGISTERED and in
state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the UE performs a successful attach or combined attach procedure in
S1 mode, it shall enter substates GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE resets the attach attempt counter
and the GPRS attach attempt counter (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]).

If the UE performs a successful GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach
procedure in A/Gb or Iu mode, it shall enter substates
GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE. The
UE resets the attach attempt counter and the GPRS attach attempt counter
(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]).

At intersystem change from A/Gb or Iu mode to S1 mode when no PDP
context is active, if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not
supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall move to state
EMM-DEREGISTERED and state GMM-DEREGISTERED and then initiate an attach
procedure. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the
UE and the MME, the UE shall enter substates
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and GMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and
initiate a tracking area updating procedure.

After successful completion of routing area updating or combined routing
area updating and tracking area updating or combined tracking area
updating procedures in both S1 mode and A/Gb or Iu mode, if the network
has indicated that ISR is activated, the UE shall maintain registration
and related periodic update timers in both GMM and EMM.

NOTE: As specified in clause 5.5.3.2.4 of this document or
clause 4.7.5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], the UE does not activate the
ISR even if the network has indicated that the ISR is activated e.g. in
the tracking area updating procedure triggered due to a change in UE
network capability. In these scenarios, the UE only maintains one
registration and related periodic update timer in GMM or EMM.

5.1.5 Coordination between EMM and MM

UEs that operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall use
the combined EPS/IMSI attach procedure in order to attach to both EPS
and non-EPS services.

UEs that operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation and are
already attached to both EPS and non-EPS services shall use the combined
tracking area updating and periodic tracking area updating procedures.

UEs that operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation and are
already attached to both EPS and non-EPS services shall perform a
combined detach procedure in order to detach for non-EPS services.

UEs that operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation should not
use any MM timers related to MM specific procedures (e.g. T3210, T3211,
T3212, T3213) while camped on E-UTRAN, unless the re-activation of these
timers is explicitly described. If the MM timers are already running,
the UE should not react on the expiration of the timers.

If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17] and moves from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN, the UE shall:

- if timer T3242 is running, start timer T3444 with the time left on
T3242 and stop timer T3242;

- if timer T3243 is running, start timer T3445 with the time left on
T3243 and stop timer T3243;

- if the UE is attached for both EPS services and non-EPS services and
timer T3242 or timer T3243 is running, perform a combined tracking area
updating procedure; and

NOTE 1: A UE configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17] being attached for both EPS services and non-EPS
services upon moving from GERAN/UTRAN to E-UTRAN is only possible in the
case when the UE has performed a combined attach in E-UTRAN,
subsequently moved to GERAN/UTRAN and returned to E-UTRAN before timer
T3242 or timer T3243 expires.

- if the UE is attached for non-EPS services only and timer T3242 or
timer T3243 is running, perform a combined attach procedure.

NOTE 2: Timers T3242 and T3243 are specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

5.2 Behaviour of the UE in state EMM-DEREGISTERED and state EMM-REGISTERED

5.2.1 General

In this clause, the detailed behaviour of the UE in the states
EMM-DEREGISTERED and EMM-REGISTERED is described.

5.2.2 UE behaviour in state EMM-DEREGISTERED

5.2.2.1 General

The state EMM-DEREGISTERED is entered in the UE, when:

- the detach or combined detach is performed either by the UE or by the
MME (see clause 5.5.2);

- the attach request is rejected by the MME (see clause 5.5.1);

- the tracking area update request is rejected by the MME (see
clause 5.5.3);

- the service request procedure is rejected by the MME (see
clause 5.6.1);

- the UE deactivates all EPS bearer contexts locally (see
clause 6.4.4.6);

- the UE is switched on;

- an inter-system change from S1 mode to non‑3GPP access is completed
and the non‑3GPP access network provides PDN connectivity to the same
EPC; or

- the UE attached for emergency bearer services is in EMM-IDLE mode and
its periodic tracking area update timer expires (see clause 5.3.5).

In state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE shall behave according to the substate
as explained in clause 5.2.2.3.

5.2.2.2 Primary substate selection

5.2.2.2.1 Selection of the substate after power on

For a UE configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17], timers T3444 and T3445 are considered to have
expired at power on. When the UE is switched on, the substate shall be
PLMN-SEARCH if the USIM is available and valid. See 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]
for further details.

The substate chosen after PLMN-SEARCH, following power on is:

- if no cell can be selected, the substate shall be NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

- if no USIM is present, the substate shall be NO-IMSI;

- if a suitable cell has been found and the PLMN or tracking area is not
in the forbidden list, then the substate shall be NORMAL-SERVICE;

- if the selected cell is known not to be able to provide normal
service, then the UE shall enter the substate LIMITED-SERVICE;

- if the UE is in manual network selection mode and no cell of the
selected PLMN has been found, the UE shall enter the substate
NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

- if the selected cell is a non-3GPP cell, the substate shall be
NO-CELL-AVAILABLE; and

- if the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17], the substate shall be eCALL-INACTIVE.

5.2.2.3 Detailed description of UE behaviour in state EMM-DEREGISTERED

5.2.2.3.1 NORMAL-SERVICE

The UE shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure if timer
T3346 is not running. If timer T3346 is running, the UE shall initiate
an attach or combined attach procedure on the expiry of timer T3346.

The UE may initiate attach for emergency bearer services even if timer
T3346 is running.

5.2.2.3.2 LIMITED-SERVICE

The UE shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure when
entering a cell which provides normal service.

The UE may initiate attach for emergency bearer services.

The UE may initiate attach for access to RLOS.

5.2.2.3.3 ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH

The UE:

- shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure on the expiry of
timers T3411, T3402 or T3346 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]);

- may initiate an attach for emergency bearer services even if timer
T3346 is running;

- may initiate an attach if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 - 15
in the selected PLMN, even if timer T3402, T3346 or timer T3447 is
running;

- shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure when entering a
new PLMN, if timer T3346 is running and the new PLMN is not equivalent
to the PLMN where the UE started timer T3346, the PLMN identity of the
new cell is not in one of the forbidden PLMN lists and the tracking area
is not in one of the lists of forbidden tracking areas;

- shall initiate an attach or combined attach procedure when the
tracking area of the serving cell has changed, if timer T3346 is not
running, the PLMN identity of the new cell is not in one of the
forbidden PLMN lists and the tracking area of the new cell is not in one
of the lists of forbidden tracking areas;

- shall use requests for non-EPS services for non-emergency call from CM
layers to trigger a combined attach procedure, if timer T3346 is not
running (see clause 5.5.1.3), or to attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN
radio access technology and proceed with the appropriate MM and CC
specific procedures;

- shall use requests for non-EPS services for emergency call from CM
layers to attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and
proceed with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures;

- may initiate an attach procedure upon receiving a request from upper
layers to transmit user data related to an exceptional event and the UE
is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the
ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]) if timer T3346 is not already running for "MO
exception data" and even if timer T3402 or timer T3411 is running;

- may initiate an attach procedure upon request of the upper layers to
establish a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; and

- may initiate an attach procedure upon request of the upper layers to
establish a PDN connection for RLOS, if timer T3346 is not running.

5.2.2.3.4 PLMN-SEARCH

The UE shall perform PLMN selection. If a new PLMN is selected, the UE
shall reset the attach attempt counter and initiate the attach or
combined attach procedure (see clause 5.5.1).

If the selected cell is known not to be able to provide normal service:

- the UE may initiate attach for emergency bearer services; or

- the UE may initiate attach for access to RLOS.

5.2.2.3.5 NO-IMSI

The UE shall perform cell selection according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

The UE may initiate attach for emergency bearer services.

The UE may initiate attach for access to RLOS.

5.2.2.3.6 ATTACH-NEEDED

The UE shall initiate the attach or combined attach procedure, if still
needed, as soon as the access is allowed in the selected cell for one of
the access classes of the UE.

The UE may initiate attach for emergency bearer services.

The UE may initiate attach for access to RLOS.

5.2.2.3.7 NO-CELL-AVAILABLE

The UE shall perform cell selection according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21] and
choose an appropriate substate when a cell is found. When the lower
layers indicate to prepare for an S101 mode to S1 mode handover and the
PLMN identity of the target cell provided with this indication is not in
one of forbidden PLMN lists, the UE shall enter substate NORMAL-SERVICE.

NOTE: It is assumed that the UE can determine the PLMN identity of
networks supporting cdma2000^(®) HRPD access from the information
broadcast over the radio interface. For the purpose of S101 mode to S1
mode handover, the UE can use the PLMN identity of the visited
cdma2000^(®) HRPD network also as PLMN identity of the target cell.

5.2.2.3.8 eCALL-INACTIVE

The UE camps on a suitable cell or an acceptable cell in a PLMN selected
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] but initiates no EMM signalling with
the network and ignores any paging requests.

The UE shall leave substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state only
when one of the following events occur:

- if the USIM is removed, the UE enters substate
EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI;

- if coverage is lost, the UE enters substate
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH;

- if the UE is deactivated (e.g. powered off) by the user, the UE enters
state EMM-NULL;

- if the UE receives a request from upper layers to establish an eCall
over IMS, the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH. The
UE then uses the relevant EMM and ESM procedures to establish the eCall
over IMS at the earliest opportunity; or

- if the UE receives a request from upper layers to establish a call to
an HPLMN designated non-emergency MSISDN or URI for test or terminal
reconfiguration service, the UE enters state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH. Once the attach procedure is
completed, the UE uses the relevant EMM and ESM procedures to establish
the non-emergency call.

5.2.2.4 Substate when back to state EMM-DEREGISTERED from another EMM state

When returning to state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE shall select a cell as
specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

The substate depends on the result of the cell selection procedure, the
outcome of the previously performed EMM specific procedures, on the EPS
update status of the UE, on the tracking area data stored in the UE, on
the presence of the USIM, on the UE configuration and on the reason for
moving to EMM-DEREGISTERED:

- If no cell has been found, the substate is NO-CELL-AVAILABLE, until a
cell is found.

- If no USIM is present or if the inserted USIM is considered invalid by
the UE, the substate shall be NO-IMSI.

- If a suitable cell has been found and the PLMN or tracking area is not
in the forbidden list, the substate shall be NORMAL-SERVICE.

- If an attach shall be performed (e.g. network requested re-attach),
the substate shall be ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH.

- If a PLMN reselection (according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]) is needed, the
substate shall be PLMN-SEARCH.

- If the selected cell is known not to be able to provide normal
service, the substate shall be LIMITED-SERVICE;

- If the selected cell is a non-3GPP cell, the substate shall be
NO-CELL-AVAILABLE; and

- If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17], T3444 and T3445 have expired or are not running,
and substate PLMN-SEARCH is not required, the substate shall be
eCALL-INACTIVE.

5.3 General on elementary EMM procedures

5.3.1 EMM modes and NAS signalling connection

5.3.1.1 Establishment of the NAS signalling connection

When the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication and needs to
transmit an initial NAS message, the UE shall request the lower layer to
establish a RRC connection. In this request to the lower layer the NAS
shall provide to the lower layer the RRC establishment cause and the
call type as specified in annex D of this specification and, for the
case specified in clause 5.6.1.2.2, shall also provide the initial NAS
message, otherwise NAS may also provide the initial NAS message.

Initial NAS messages are:

- ATTACH REQUEST;

- DETACH REQUEST;

- TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST;

- SERVICE REQUEST;

- EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST; and

- CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST.

When the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, the UE shall
proceed the behaviour as specified in clauses 5.3.1.3.

For the routing of the initial NAS message to the appropriate MME, the
UE NAS provides the lower layers with either the S-TMSI, the registered
globally unique MME identifier (GUMMEI) that consists of the PLMN ID,
the MME group ID, and the MME code (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [2]), or none of
them according to the following rules:

- If the UE has received the interworking without N26 interface
indicator set to "interworking without N26 interface not supported" from
the network, the UE holds a valid 5G-GUTI and:

a) the UE performs an initial EPS attach procedure or tracking area
updating procedure following an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1
mode; or

b) the UE which was previously registered in N1 mode before entering
state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, performs an initial EPS attach procedure,

then the UE NAS shall provide the lower layers with the MME identifier
part of the mapped GUTI, which is generated from the 5G-GUTI as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [4], an indication that the identifier is a
native GUMMEI and an indication that the identifier is mapped from 5GS;

- If the TIN indicates "GUTI" or "RAT-related TMSI", or the TIN is not
available, and the UE holds a valid GUTI:

a) When the UE in EMM-IDLE mode initiates a tracking area updating or
combined tracking area updating procedure for load balancing purposes,
the UE NAS shall provide the lower layers with neither S-TMSI nor
registered MME identifier;

b) When the tracking area of the current cell is in the list of tracking
areas that the UE previously registered in the MME during the NAS
signalling connection establishment, the UE NAS shall provide the lower
layers with the S-TMSI, but shall not provide the registered MME
identifier to the lower layers; or

c) When the tracking area of the current cell is not in the list of
tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the MME during the
NAS signalling connection establishment, the UE NAS shall provide the
lower layers with the MME identifier part of the valid GUTI with an
indication that the identifier is a native GUMMEI.

- If the TIN indicates "P-TMSI", or the TIN is not available, and the UE
holds a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the UE NAS shall provide the lower layers
with the MME identifier part of the mapped GUTI, which is generated from
the P-TMSI and RAI with an indication that the identifier is a mapped
GUMMEI; or

- Otherwise, the UE NAS does not provide the lower layers with the
S-TMSI, the registered GUMMEI and the mapped GUMMEI.

The UE NAS also provides the lower layers with the identity of the
selected PLMN (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). In a shared network, the UE
shall choose one of the PLMN identities as specified in
3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

When an ATTACH REQUEST message, or a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message when the current TAI of the current cell is not included in the
TAI list, is sent to establish a signalling connection, the UE NAS also
provides the lower layers with the DCN-ID according to the following
rules:

a) if a DCN-ID for the PLMN code of the selected PLMN is available in
the UE, the UE NAS shall provide this DCN-ID to the lower layers; or

b) if no DCN-ID for the PLMN code of the selected PLMN is available but
a Default_DCN_ID value is available in the UE, as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17], the UE NAS shall provide this DCN-ID to the lower
layers.

If a relay node is attaching for relay node operation (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]), the NAS in the relay node shall indicate to the
lower layers that the establishment of the NAS signalling connection is
for a relay node.

If a UE operating as an IAB-node performs an attach procedure, tracking
area updating procedure, or service request procedure (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]), the UE NAS shall indicate to the lower layers that
the establishment of the NAS signalling connection is for a UE operating
as an IAB-node.

In S1 mode, when the RRC connection has been established successfully,
the UE shall enter EMM-CONNECTED mode and consider the NAS signalling
connection established.

In S101 mode, when the cdma2000^(®) HRPD access network resources are
available for tunnelled NAS signalling, the UE shall enter EMM-CONNECTED
mode and consider the S101 mode NAS signalling connection established.

5.3.1.2 Release of the NAS signalling connection

5.3.1.2.1 General

The signalling procedure for the release of the NAS signalling
connection is initiated by the network.

In S1 mode, when the RRC connection has been released, the UE shall
enter EMM-IDLE mode and consider the NAS signalling connection released.

If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17] then:

- if the NAS signalling connection that was released had been
established for eCall over IMS, the UE shall start timer T3444; and

- if the NAS signalling connection that was released had been
established for a call to an HPLMN designated non-emergency MSISDN or
URI for test or terminal reconfiguration service, the UE shall start
timer T3445.

The UE shall start the SGC timer T3447 with the service gap time value
available in the UE when the NAS signalling connection is released if:

- the UE supports SGC feature, and the service gap timer value is
available in the UE and does not indicate zero; and

- the NAS signalling connection that was released had been established
for mobile originated request for transfer of uplink data.

If the UE receives the "Extended wait time" from the lower layers when
no attach, tracking area updating or service request procedure is
ongoing, the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

To allow the network to release the NAS signalling connection, the UE:

a) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives any of the EMM cause

type to "NAS signalling connection release" in the UE request type IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the NAS signalling
connection release bit is set to "NAS signalling connection release
supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message; and

- the user plane radio bearers have not been set up;

message and the UE has set the detach type to "IMSI detach" in the
DETACH REQUEST message and user plane radio bearers have not been set
up;

d) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REJECT message indicating:

- any of the EMM cause values #9 or #10 and the UE has no CS fallback
emergency call, CS fallback call, 1xCS fallback emergency call, or 1xCS
fallback call pending; or

- the EMM cause values #40, the TRACKING AREA UPDATE message was not
triggered due to receiving a paging for CS fallback or a paging for 1xCS
fallback, and the UE has no CS fallback emergency call, CS fallback
call, 1xCS fallback emergency call, or 1xCS fallback call pending;

e) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a SERVICE REJECT
message indicating any of the EMM cause values #9, #10 or #40 as a
response to a SERVICE REQUEST message CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
message, or an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message with service type set to
"packet services via S1";

f) may start the timer T3440 if the UE receives any of the EMM cause
values #3, #6, #7 or #8 or if it receives an AUTHENTICATION REJECT
message;

g) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a SERVICE REJECT
message indicating the EMM cause value #39 and the UE has initiated
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST in EMM-IDLE and the user plane radio bearers
have not been set up;

h) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a SERVICE REJECT,
SERVICE ACCEPT, ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
with control plane data back-off timer;

i) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives the EMM cause value
#22 along with a T3346 value, and the value indicates that the timer
T3346 is neither zero nor deactivated;

j) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a SERVICE ACCEPT
message and the UE has set Request type to "NAS signalling connection
release" or to "Rejection of paging" in the UE request type IE in the
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message;

k) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a SERVICE ACCEPT
message, the UE has set the Control plane service type of the CONTROL
PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message to "mobile terminating request" and the
"active" flag in the Control plane service type IE to 0, the user plane
radio bearers have not been set up, and the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message was sent from EMM-IDLE mode;

l) shall start the timer T3440 if the UE receives a DETACH ACCEPT
message and the UE has set the detach type to "EPS detach" or "combined
EPS/IMSI detach" in the DETACH REQUEST message; or

m) shall start the timer T3440 after the completion of the DETACH
procedure, if the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message and the detach
type indicates "re-attach required".

Upon expiry of T3440,

- in cases a, a1, b, c, f, h, i, j and l, the UE shall locally release
the established NAS signalling connection;

- in cases d and e, the UE shall locally release the established NAS

In cases b, c and g,

- upon an indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio
bearers are set up, the UE shall stop timer T3440 and may send uplink
signalling via the existing NAS signalling connection or user data via
the user plane bearers. If the uplink signalling is for CS fallback for
emergency call, or for establishing a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services, the UE shall send the uplink signalling via the
existing NAS signalling connection; or

In cases b, c, g and j,

- upon receipt of a DETACH REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer
T3440 and respond to the network initiated detach as specified in
clause 5.5.2.3.

In case b, j and k,

- upon receiving a request from upper layers to send NAS signalling not
associated with establishing either a CS emergency call or a PDN

local release of the established NAS signalling connection upon expiry
of timer T3440 or T3440 being stopped before proceeding;

- upon receiving a request from upper layers to establish either a CS
emergency call or a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE
shall stop timer T3440 and shall locally release the NAS signalling
connection, before proceeding as specified in clause 5.6.1;

- upon receipt of ESM DATA TRANSPORT message, as an implementation
option, the UE may reset and restart timer T3440;

- upon receipt of a DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT or DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS
TRANSPORT message, the UE which is in EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connections shall stop timer T3440 and may send uplink signalling via
the existing NAS signalling connection;

- upon receipt of an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, MODIFY
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST,
DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT or DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message, if the
UE is using control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the UE shall stop timer
T3440 and may send uplink signalling via the existing NAS signalling
connection; or

- upon initiation of tracking area updating procedure or combined
tracking area updating procedure due to detecting the current TAI is not
in the TAI list as specified in clause 5.5.3.2.6 for cases e, i, j,
clause 5.5.3.2.2 for case a or clause 5.5.3.3.2 for case a, the UE shall
stop timer T3440.

In case c,

- upon receiving a request from upper layers to send NAS signalling not
associated with establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services, the UE shall wait for the local release of the established NAS
signalling connection upon expiry of timer T3440 or T3440 being stopped
before proceeding; or

- upon receiving a request from upper layers to establish a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall stop timer T3440
and shall locally release the NAS signalling connection, before
proceeding as specified in clause 5.6.1.

In cases d and e,

- upon an indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has
been released, the UE shall stop timer T3440 and perform a new attach
procedure as specified in clause 5.5.3.2.5, 5.5.3.3.5 or 5.6.1.5; or

- upon receiving a request from upper layers to establish a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall stop timer T3440
and shall locally release the NAS signalling connection, before
proceeding as specified in clause 5.5.1.

In cases a and f,

- upon receiving a request from upper layers to establish a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall stop timer T3440
and shall locally release the NAS signalling connection, before
proceeding as specified in clause 5.5.1.

In case g,

- upon receiving a request from upper layers to send NAS signalling not
associated with establishing either a CS emergency call or a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall wait for the
local release of the established NAS signalling connection upon expiry
of timer T3440 or T3440 being stopped before proceeding; or

- upon receiving a request from upper layers to establish either a CS
emergency call or a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE
shall stop timer T3440 and shall locally release the NAS signalling
connection, before proceeding as specified in clause 5.6.1.

In case h,

- upon an indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio
bearers are set up or upon receiving a request from upper layers to send
NAS signalling not associated with ESM DATA TRANSPORT, the UE shall stop
timer T3440; or

- the UE shall not send ESM DATA TRANSPORT message until expiry of timer
T3440 or times T3440 being stopped.

In EMM-CONNECTED mode, if the UE moves to EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED
state upon receipt of a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message, the UE shall
stop timer T3440.

In S101 mode, when the cdma2000^(®) HRPD radio access connection has
been released, the UE shall enter EMM-IDLE mode and consider the S101
mode NAS signalling connection released.

If the timer T3440 is not running when the UE enters state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH or EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, the UE may
locally release the NAS signalling connection.

5.3.1.2.2 UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization

Upon receipt of the indication from the ESM layer to release the NAS
signalling connection (see clause 6.6.4.2), unless the MME has
additional downlink user data or signalling pending, the MME shall
initiate release of the NAS signalling connection.

5.3.1.3 Suspend and resume of the NAS signalling connection

Suspend of the NAS signalling connection can be initiated by the network
in EMM-CONNECTED mode when user plane CIoT EPS optimization is used.
Resume of the suspended NAS signalling connection is initiated by the
UE.

In the UE, when user plane CIoT EPS optimization is used:

- Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been
suspended, the UE shall enter EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication,
shall not consider the NAS signalling connection released and shall not
consider the secure exchange of NAS messages terminated (see
clause 4.4.2.3 and 4.4.5). Based on further indications provided by the
lower layers, the UE shall update the status of the suspend indication
for the EMM-IDLE mode;

- Upon trigger of a procedure using an initial NAS message when in
EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, the UE shall:

i) if the initial NAS message is a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message
which includes a UE radio capability information update needed IE, enter
EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication and proceed with the tracking
area updating procedure; and

ii) otherwise, request the lower layer to resume the RRC connection. In
this request to the lower layer the NAS shall provide to the lower layer
the RRC establishment cause and the call type according to annex D of
this document;

NOTE 1: In NB-S1 mode, in the request to the lower layer the data volume
information of the initial NAS message is provided to the lower layers.
Interactions between the NAS and the lower layers in order to obtain the
data volume information of the initial NAS message (see
3GPP TS 36.321 [49], 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) is left to implementations.

- Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been
resumed when in EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, the UE shall
enter EMM-CONNECTED mode. If the pending NAS message is:

i) a SERVICE REQUEST message;

ii) a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, and the UE did not include
any ESM message container, NAS message container, EPS bearer context
status information element, or UE request type information element; or

iii) an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, and the Service type
information element indicates "packet services via S1" and the UE did
not include any EPS bearer context status information element, or UE
request type information element;

the message shall not be sent. Otherwise the UE shall cipher the message
as specified in clause 4.4.5 and send the pending initial NAS message
upon entering EMM-CONNECTED mode;

NOTE 2: If a NAS message is discarded and not sent to the network, the
uplink NAS COUNT value corresponding to that message is reused for the
next uplink NAS message to be sent.

- Upon fallback indication from the lower layers at RRC connection
resume when in EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, the UE shall enter
EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication, send any pending initial NAS
message and proceed as if RRC connection establishment had been
requested;

- Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection resume
has failed and indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection
is suspended, the UE shall enter EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication
and restart the ongoing NAS procedure if required; and

- Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection resume
has failed and indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection
is not suspended, the UE shall enter EMM-IDLE mode without suspend
indication and restart the ongoing NAS procedure if required.

In the network, when user plane CIoT EPS optimization is used:

- Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been
suspended, the network shall enter EMM-IDLE mode with suspend
indication, shall not consider the NAS signalling connection released
and shall not consider the secure exchange of NAS messages terminated;
and

- Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been
resumed when in EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, the network shall
enter EMM-CONNECTED mode.

For the case that not all suspended bearers are resumed, see
clause 6.4.4.6.

5.3.2 Lists of forbidden tracking areas

The UE shall store a list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming", as
well as a list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service". These lists shall be erased when the UE is switched off or
when the UICC containing the USIM is removed, and periodically (with a
period in the range 12 to 24 hours). When the lists are erased, the UE
performs cell selection according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]. One or more
tracking areas is removed from the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" in the UE, as well as the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service" if, after a subsequent procedure e.g.
attach procedure, tracking area updating procedure and GUTI reallocation
procedure, one or more tracking areas in the lists is received from the
network. If the UE has only one PDN connection established which is for
emergency bearer services, the tracking areas shall not be removed from
these lists if one or more tracking areas in the lists are received from
the network.

In S1 mode, the UE shall update the suitable list whenever an ATTACH
REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT, SERVICE REJECT or DETACH REQUEST
message is received with the EMM cause #12 "tracking area not allowed",
#13 "roaming not allowed in this tracking area", or #15 "no suitable
cells in tracking area" or an ATTACH ACCEPT or a TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message is received with the forbidden TAI(s).

In S1 mode, if the UE receives the "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" IE or the "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service" IE in the ATTACH REJECT, ATTACH ACCEPT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT , SERVICE REJECT or DETACH REQUEST
message, the UE shall update the suitable list with the TAI(s) included
in the IEs which are belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s)
and ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong to the serving PLMN or
equivalent PLMN(s).

Each list shall accommodate 40 or more TAIs. When the list is full and a
new entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry shall be deleted.

5.3.3 List of forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode

A UE supporting S101 mode shall store a list of "forbidden PLMNs for
attach in S101 mode". The UE shall erase this list when the UE is
switched off or when the USIM is removed.

In S101 mode, the UE shall add to the "forbidden PLMNs for attach in
S101 mode" list the PLMN identity provided with the indication from the
lower layers to prepare for an S101 mode to S1 mode handover whenever an
ATTACH REJECT message is received with the EMM cause #11 "PLMN not
allowed", #12 "tracking area not allowed", #13 "roaming not allowed in
this tracking area", #14 "EPS services not allowed in this PLMN", #15
"no suitable cells in tracking area", or #35 "Requested service option
not authorized in this PLMN" as specified in clause 5.5.1.2.5.

The maximum number of possible entries in the "forbidden PLMNs for
attach in S101 mode" list is implementation dependent, but the list
shall accommodate at least one PLMN identity. When the list is full and
a new PLMN identity has to be inserted, the UE shall delete the oldest
PLMN identity.

5.3.3a Forbidden PLMNs for EPS services

The forbidden PLMNs for EPS services are contained in the "forbidden
PLMNs for GPRS service" list, as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]. The UE
updates this list as part of the attach procedure, tracking area
updating procedure and network initiated detach procedure as described
respectively in clauses 5.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.5.2.3.2.

5.3.4 Equivalent PLMNs list

The UE shall store a list of equivalent PLMNs. These PLMNs shall be
regarded by the UE as equivalent to each other for PLMN selection and
cell selection/re-selection. The same list is used by 5GMM, EMM, GMM and
MM.

The UE shall update or delete this list at the end of each attach or
combined attach or tracking area updating or combined tracking area
updating procedure. The stored list consists of a list of equivalent
PLMNs as downloaded by the network plus the PLMN code of the registered
PLMN that downloaded the list. When the UE is switched off, it shall
keep the stored list so that it can be used for PLMN selection after
switch on. The UE shall delete the stored list if the USIM is removed or
when the UE attached for emergency bearer services or access to RLOS
enters the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. The maximum number of possible
entries in the stored list is 16.

5.3.5 Handling of the periodic tracking area update timer and mobile reachable timer (S1 mode only)

The periodic tracking area updating procedure is used to periodically
notify the availability of the UE to the network. The procedure is
controlled in the UE by timer T3412. The value of timer T3412 is sent by
the network to the UE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and can be sent in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The UE shall apply this value
in all tracking areas of the list of tracking areas assigned to the UE
until a new value is received.

If timer T3412 received by the UE in an ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an indication that the timer is
deactivated or the timer value is zero, then timer T3412 is deactivated
and the UE shall not perform the periodic tracking area updating
procedure.

Timer T3412 is reset and started with its initial value, when the UE
changes from EMM-CONNECTED to EMM-IDLE mode. Timer T3412 is stopped when
the UE enters EMM-CONNECTED mode or the EMM-DEREGISTERED state.

If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, and timer T3412
expires, the UE shall not initiate a periodic tracking area updating
procedure, but shall locally detach from the network. When the UE is
camping on a suitable cell, it may re-attach to regain normal service.

When a UE is not attached for emergency bearer services, and timer T3412
expires, the periodic tracking area updating procedure shall be started
and the timer shall be set to its initial value for the next start.

If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services, and is in a
state other than EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE when timer T3412 expires,
the periodic tracking area updating procedure is delayed until the UE
returns to EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

NOTE 1: When the UE returns to EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and it
needs to initiate other EMM procedure than the periodic tracking area
updating procedure then, based on UE implementation, the EMM procedure
can take precedence.

If ISR is activated, the UE shall keep both timer T3412 and timer T3312.
The two separate timers run in the UE for updating MME and SGSN
independently. The UE shall start timer T3423, if timer T3412 expires,
and timer T3346 is running or the UE is in one of the following states:

- EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

- EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH;

- EMM-REGISTERED.UPDATE-NEEDED; or

- EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

The UE shall initiate the tracking area updating procedure and stop
timer T3423 when it enters state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE before
timer T3423 expires. After expiry of timer T3423 the UE shall set its
TIN to "P-TMSI".

If timer T3423 expires the UE shall memorize that it has to initiate a
tracking area updating procedure when it returns to state
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

If the UE is attached to both EPS and non-EPS services, and if timer
T3412 expires or timer T3423 expires when the UE is in
EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE state, then the UE shall initiate the
combined tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA
updating with IMSI attach" when the UE returns to
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state.

When the network includes T3412 extended value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the network uses timer
T3412 extended value IE as the value of timer T3412.

The network supervises the periodic tracking area updating procedure of
the UE by means of the mobile reachable timer.

If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services, the mobile
reachable timer shall be longer than T3412. In this case, by default,
the mobile reachable timer is 4 minutes greater than timer T3412.

If ISR is not activated, the network behaviour upon expiry of the mobile
reachable timer is network dependent, but typically the network stops
sending paging messages to the UE on the first expiry, and may take
other appropriate actions.

If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the MME shall set
the mobile reachable timer with a value equal to timer T3412. When the
mobile reachable timer expires, the MME shall locally detach the UE.

The mobile reachable timer shall be reset and started with the value as
indicated above, when the MME releases the NAS signalling connection for
the UE. The mobile reachable timer shall be stopped when a NAS
signalling connection is established for the UE.

Upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer the network shall start the
implicit detach timer. The value of the implicit detach timer is network
dependent. If ISR is activated, the default value of the implicit detach
timer is 4 minutes greater than timer T3423. If the implicit detach
timer expires before the UE contacts the network, the network shall
implicitly detach the UE. If the MME includes timer T3346 in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message or the SERVICE REJECT message and
timer T3346 is greater than timer T3412, the MME sets the mobile
reachable timer and the implicit detach timer such that the sum of the
timer values is greater than timer T3346.

If the network includes the T3324 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message
or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and if the UE is not attached
for emergency bearer services and has no PDN connection for emergency
bearer services the MME shall set the active timer to a value equal to
the value of timer T3324.

NOTE 2: Timer T3324 is specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

If the UE has established a PDN connection for emergency services after
receiving the timer T3324 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or the
last TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the active timer shall not be
started.

The active timer shall be reset and started with the value as indicated
above, when the MME releases the NAS signalling connection for the UE.
The active timer shall be stopped when an NAS signalling connection is
established for the UE.

The network behaviour upon expiry of the active timer is network
dependent, but typically the network stops sending paging messages to
the UE on the first expiry, and may take other appropriate actions.

NOTE 3: ISR is not activated when the network includes the T3324 value
IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

The implicit detach timer shall be stopped when a NAS signalling
connection is established for the UE.

5.3.6 Handling of timer T3402

The value of timer T3402 can be sent by the network to the UE in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the
value is different from "deactivated", the UE shall apply this value in
all tracking areas of the list of tracking areas assigned to the UE,
until a new value is received.

The value of timer T3402 can be sent by the network to the UE in the
ATTACH REJECT message. If an ATTACH REJECT message including timer T3402
value different from "deactivated", was received integrity protected,
the UE shall apply this value until a new value is received with
integrity protection or a new PLMN is selected. Otherwise, the default
value of this timer is used.

The default value of this timer is also used by the UE in the following
cases:

- ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is
received without a value specified, and the EPS update type in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is not set to "periodic updating";

- the network indicates that the timer is "deactivated";

- the UE does not have a stored value for this timer;

- a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs has been
entered, the tracking area updating fails and the tracking area updating
attempt counter is equal to 5; or

- a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs has been
entered, the attach procedure fails, the attach attempt counter is equal
to 5 and no ATTACH REJECT message was received from the new PLMN.

5.3.7 Handling of the Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List

The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency
Numbers list contain additional local emergency numbers used by the
serving network. These lists can be downloaded by the network to the UE
at successful registration and subsequent registration updates. There is
only one Local Emergency Numbers List and only one Extended Local
Emergency Numbers list in the UE. The Local Emergency Numbers List can
be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode, with GMM and MM
procedures if the UE is in A/Gb or Iu mode, and with 5GMM procedures, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54], if UE is in N1 mode. The Extended
Local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM procedures if the
UE is in S1 mode and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54], if UE is in N1 mode.

The UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List and the stored
Extended Local Emergency Numbers List received from the network in
addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM or user equipment
to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number.

If the UE determines that the number dialled is an emergency number, the
procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.167 [45] and 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] are
utilised to select a domain for the emergency session attempt.

If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the PS
domain, then the UE shall perform the session establishment procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] to initiate an emergency session.

If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the CS
domain (e.g. the UE has selected GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology), then the UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers
List, in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM and the
ME, to determine if:

- the UE is to send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message:

1) for CS fallback, indicating "mobile originating CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback"; or

2) for CS fallback for emergency call, indicating "mobile originating CS
fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call"; and

- the call control entity of the UE specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] is
to send an EMERGENCY SETUP message or a SETUP message to the network.

NOTE 1: The checking of whether the dialled number is an emergency
number and the determination of whether an emergency call is to be
initiated in the CS domain, can end once a match is found. The Extended
Local Emergency Numbers List does not apply when the CS domain is
selected.

NOTE 2: The user equipment can use the emergency numbers in each of the
stored lists to assist the end user in determining whether the dialled
number is intended for an emergency service or for another destination,
e.g. a local directory service. The possible interactions with the end
user are implementation specific.

NOTE 3: A UE that supports procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 [48],
can get additional local emergency numbers through those procedures,
which can be used based on operator policy, see 3GPP TS 24.302 [48].

The network may send a Local Emergency Numbers List or an Extended Local
Emergency Numbers List or both, in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, by including the Emergency number
list IE and the Extended emergency number list IE, respectively. The
user equipment shall store the Local Emergency Numbers List and the
Extended Local Emergency Numbers List, as provided by the network. The
Local Emergency Numbers List stored in the user equipment shall be
replaced on each receipt of the Emergency number list IE. The Extended
Local Emergency Numbers List stored in the user equipment shall be
replaced on each receipt of the Extended emergency number list IE. The
received Local Emergency Numbers List or the received Extended Local
Emergency Numbers list or both shall be provided to the upper layers.

The emergency number(s) received in the Emergency number list IE are
valid only in networks in the same country as the PLMN from which this
IE is received. If no Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message,
then the stored Local Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment shall
be kept, except if the user equipment has successfully registered to a
PLMN in a country different from that of the PLMN that sent the list.

The emergency number(s) received in the Extended emergency number list
IE are valid only in:

- networks in the same country as the PLMN from which this IE is
received, if the Extended Emergency Number List Validity (EENLV) field
within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates "Extended Local
Emergency Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which
this IE is received"; and

- the PLMN from which this IE is received, if the EENLV field within the
Extended emergency number list IE indicates "Extended Local Emergency
Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received".

If no Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the
registered PLMN has not changed, then the stored Extended Local
Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment shall be kept. If no
Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, but the
registered PLMN has changed, then:

- if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended
emergency number list IE indicates "Extended Local Emergency Numbers
List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received", the
stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment shall
be deleted; and

- if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended
emergency number list IE indicates "Extended Local Emergency Numbers
List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which this IE is received"
the list shall be kept except if the user equipment has successfully
registered to a PLMN in a country different from that of the PLMN that
sent the list.

NOTE: To prevent the misrouting of emergency calls, all operators within
a country need to follow the regulation or agree on the setting of the
Extended emergency number list IE in accordance to national agreement –
either to indicate validity within a country or to indicate validity
only within the PLMN.

The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency
Numbers List shall be deleted at switch off and removal of the USIM. The
user equipment shall be able to store up to ten entries in the Local
Emergency Numbers List and up to twenty entries in the Extended Local
Emergency Numbers List, received from the network.

5.3.7a Specific requirements for UE configured to use timer T3245

The following requirement applies for an UE that is configured to use
timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]):

When the UE adds a PLMN identity to the "forbidden PLMN list", the
"forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode" list, or the "forbidden PLMNs
for GPRS service" list or sets the USIM as invalid for non-EPS services
or EPS services or both, and timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) is
not running, the UE shall start timer T3245 as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13], clause 4.1.1.6.

Upon expiry of the timer T3245, the UE shall erase the "forbidden PLMN
list", the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list, and the "forbidden
PLMNs for attach in S101 mode" list and set the USIM to valid for
non-EPS and EPS services. When the lists are erased, the UE performs
cell selection according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3245 is running, the UE shall
behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE
remains the same:

- let t1 be the time remaining for T3245 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the UE will follow the behaviour as
defined in the paragraph above upon expiry of the timer T3245. If the UE
is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1.

5.3.7b Specific requirements for UE when receiving non-integrity protected reject messages

This clause specifies the requirements for a UE that is not configured
to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and
receives an ATTACH REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT or SERVICE REJECT
message without integrity protection with specific EMM causes.

NOTE 1: Additional UE requirements for this case, requirements for other
EMM causes, and requirements for the case when the UE receives an
integrity protected reject message are specified in clauses 5.5.1, 5.5.3
and 5.6.1.

The UE may maintain a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and a list
of PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). The
maximum number of possible entries in each list is implementation
dependent.

Additionally, the UE may maintain one counter for "SIM/USIM considered
invalid for non-GPRS services" events and one counter for "SIM/USIM
considered invalid for GPRS services" events (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]).

If the UE maintains the above lists of attempt counters and the event
counters, a UE supporting N1 mode, shall store them in its non-volatile
memory. The UE shall erase the lists and reset the event counters to
zero when the UICC containing the USIM is removed. The counter values
shall not be affected by the activation or deactivation of power saving
mode or MICO mode (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]).

If the UE receives an ATTACH REJECT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT or
SERVICE REJECT message without integrity protection with EMM cause value
#3, #6, #7, #8, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15, #31 or #35 before the network
has established secure exchange of NAS messages for the NAS signalling
connection, the UE shall start timer T3247 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13])
with a random value uniformly drawn from the range between 30 minutes
and 60 minutes, if the timer is not running, and take the following
actions:

1) if the EMM cause value received is #3, #6, #7 or #8, and

a) if the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for
GPRS services" events and the counter has a value less than a UE
implementation-specific maximum value, the UE shall:

access is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value in a NAS
message without integrity protection;

- if the UE is operating in single-registration mode and the EMM cause
value received is #8, set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the 5GS

the attach attempt counter or the tracking area updating attempt counter
or the service request attempt counter, respectively;

- for the EMM cause #11 and #14, if A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by

"forbidden tracking areas for roaming" for non-integrity protected NAS
reject message and enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE; and

- the UE shall search for a suitable cell in another tracking area or in
another location area in the same PLMN according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21];

4) if the EMM cause value received is #11 or #35 and the UE is not in
its HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), in addition to the
UE requirements specified in clause 5.5.1, 5.5.3 and 5.6.1,

if the UE maintains a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and the

alternatively the UE should:

- set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and shall store
it according to clause 5.1.3.3);

- store the current TAI in the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming", memorize the current TAI was stored in the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming" for non-integrity protected NAS reject
message; and

- search for a suitable cell in another tracking area according to
3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

Upon expiry of timer T3247, the UE shall

- remove all tracking areas from the list of "forbidden tracking areas

areas for roaming", which were stored in these lists for non-integrity
protected NAS reject message;

- set the USIM to valid for EPS services, if

- the UE does not maintain a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid

- the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS
services" events and this counter has a value less than a UE
implementation-specific maximum value;

- set the USIM to valid for non-EPS services, if

- the UE does not maintain a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid

implementation-specific maximum value;

- if the UE maintains a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters, for each
PLMN-specific attempt counter that has a value greater than zero and
less than a UE implementation-specific maximum value, remove the
respective PLMN from the extension of the "forbidden PLMNs" list;

- if the UE maintains a list of PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters, for
each PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter that has a value greater than zero
and less than a UE implementation-specific maximum value, remove the
respective PLMN from the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list. If the
resulting "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list is empty, the UE shall
re-enable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5);

- if the UE is supporting A/Gb mode or Iu mode, perform the actions as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when timer T3247 expires;

- if the UE is supporting N1 mode, perform the actions as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54], clause 5.3.20.2 for the case when timer T3247
expires; and

- initiate an EPS attach procedure or tracking area updating procedure,
if still needed, dependent on EMM state and EPS update status, or
perform PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If the UE maintains a list of PLMN-specific attempt counters and
PLMN-specific PS-attempt counters, when the UE is switched off, the UE
shall, for each PLMN-specific attempt counter that has a value greater
than zero and less than the UE implementation-specific maximum value,
remove the respective PLMN from the forbidden PLMN list. When the USIM
is removed, the UE should perform this action.

NOTE 2: If the respective PLMN was stored in the extension of the
"forbidden PLMNs" list, then according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] the UE will
delete the contents of this extension when the UE is switched off or the
USIM is removed.

5.3.8 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) EMM uplink message transmission failure indication by lower layers

When it is specified in the relevant procedure that it is up to the UE
implementation to rerun the ongoing procedure that triggered that
procedure, the procedure can typically be re-initiated using a
retransmission mechanism of the uplink message (the one that has
previously failed to be transmitted) with new sequence number and
message authentication code information thus avoiding to restart the
whole procedure.

5.3.9 Handling of NAS level mobility management congestion control

The network may detect EMM signalling congestion and perform NAS level
mobility management congestion control. NAS level mobility management
congestion control consists of general NAS level mobility management
congestion control and subscribed APN based congestion control.

Under general overload conditions the network may reject mobility
management signalling requests from UEs as specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. The network should not reject the following
requests:

- requests for emergency bearer services;

- DETACH REQUEST message;

- service request or tracking area update request triggered by paging;

- requests from UEs that were received via NAS signalling connections
established with RRC establishment cause "High priority access AC 11 –
15";

- requests for attach, normal tracking area updating or periodic
tracking area updating, when emergency is indicated by lower layers;

- requests for CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency
call; and

- requests for tracking area update when the UE is reporting
unavailability information due to enhanced discontinuous coverage.

When subscribed APN based mobility management congestion control is
active for a particular APN, the network may reject attach requests from
UEs with a subscription to this APN.

In mobility management the network may detect NAS signalling congestion
and start or stop performing the subscribed APN based congestion control
based on mobility management level criteria such as:

- rate of mobility management NAS messages from a group of UEs with a
subscription to a particular APN exceeds or falls below certain
thresholds; and/or

- setting in network management.

When the NAS level mobility management congestion control is active, the
network may include a value for the mobility management back-off timer
T3346 in the reject messages. The UE starts the timer T3346 with the
value received in the mobility management reject messages. To avoid that
large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the
network should select the value for the timer T3346 for the rejected UEs
so that timeouts are not synchronised.

For subscribed APN based congestion control the value of timer T3346 for
a particular APN may be APN dependent.

If the timer T3346 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3346 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3346 is running, the UE shall
behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE
remains the same:

- let t1 be the time remaining for T3346 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1; and

- if prior to switch off, timer T3346 was started due to a NAS request
message (ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST) which contained the low
priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
priority", then if timer T3346 is restarted at switch on, the UE
configured for dual priority shall handle mobility management requests
as indicated in clauses 5.5.1.2.6, 5.5.3.2.6 and 5.6.1.6.

If the UE enters a new PLMN while timer T3346 is running, and the new
PLMN is not equivalent to the PLMN where the UE started timer T3346, the
UE shall stop timer T3346 when initiating mobility management procedures
in the new PLMN.

After change in TAI which is not part of TAI list, if the timer T3346 is
running and EMM update status is EU1 UPDATED then UE shall set the EMM
update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

5.3.9A Handling of congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane

The network may activate congestion control for transport of user data
via the control plane, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

If the congestion control for transport of user data via the control
plane is active and if the UE has indicated support for the control
plane data back-off timer, the network shall include a value for the
control plane data back-off timer T3448 in ATTACH ACCEPT, TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT, SERVICE ACCEPT or SERVICE REJECT message, and shall store
a control plane data back-off time on a per UE basis. The UE starts the
timer T3448 with the value informed in the message. To avoid that large
numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the network
should select the value for the timer T3448 for the informed UEs so that
timeouts are not synchronised.

The network sends TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or SERVICE ACCEPT
message without T3448 value IE to stop the timer T3448 running in the UE
as specified in clause 5.5.3.2.4 and clause 5.6.1.4.2.

Based on the stored control plane data back-off time for the UE, the
network may reject the transfer of user data via the control plane
initiated by the UE.

While the timer T3448 is running, the UE in EMM-IDLE mode shall not
initiate the transport of user data via the control plane procedure (see
clause 6.6.4), except if the UE is allowed to use exception data
reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS
configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EF_(NASCONFIG)
in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and the user data is related to an exceptional
event.

Upon entering the state EMM-DEREGISTERED or a new PLMN which is not
equivalent to the PLMN where the UE started the timer T3448, or upon
being switched off while the timer T3448 is running, the UE shall stop
the timer T3448. For further criteria to stop of timer T3448, refer to
clause 5.5.3.2.4 and clause 5.6.1.4.2.

5.3.10 Access class control

The network can restrict the access for certain groups of UEs by means
of barring their access class.

The UE shall evaluate the access control information as specified in
3GPP TS 36.331 [22] for:

- Access Class Barring;

- Access Control for CSFB and Extended Access Barring (EAB);

- Access Control for Application specific Congestion control for Data
Communication (ACDC), if the UE supports ACDC; and

- Access Barring.

5.3.11 Power saving mode

The UE can request the use of power saving mode (PSM) during an attach
or tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [11A] and
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). The UE shall not request the use of PSM during:

- an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;

- an attach procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach";

- a tracking area updating procedure for initiating a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services;

- a tracking area updating procedure when the UE has a PDN connection
established for emergency bearer services; or

- an attach for access to RLOS.

The network accepts the use of PSM by providing a specific value for
timer T3324 when accepting the attach or tracking area updating
procedure. The UE may use PSM only if the network has provided the T3324
value IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure with
a value different from "deactivated".

NOTE: Timer T3324 is specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

Upon expiry of the timer T3324 or if the T3324 value provided by the
network is zero, the UE may deactivate the AS layer and activate PSM by
entering the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE if:

a) the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services;

b) the UE has no PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

c) the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode;

d) in the EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state; and

e) the UE is not attached for access to RLOS.

If conditions a, b, c and e are fulfilled, but the UE is in a state
other than EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE when timer T3324 expires, the
UE may activate PSM when the MS returns to state
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

A UE that has already been allocated timer T3324 with a value different
from "deactivated" and the timer T3324 has expired, may activate PSM if
it receives an "Extended wait time" from lower layers.

When PSM is activated all NAS timers are stopped and associated
procedures aborted except for T3412, T3346, T3396, T3447, any backoff
timers, and the timer T controlling the periodic search for HPLMN or
EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) or higher prioritized PLMNs (see
3GPP TS 23.122 [6]).

If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services or has a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall not activate PSM.

If the UE is attached for access to RLOS, the UE shall not activate PSM.

The UE may deactivate PSM and activate the AS layer at any time. Upon
deactivating PSM, the UE may initiate EMM procedures (e.g. for the
transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data).

5.3.12 Extended idle-mode DRX cycle

The UE may request the use of extended idle-mode DRX cycle (eDRX) during
an attach or tracking area updating procedure by including the extended
DRX parameters IE (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [11A] and 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).
The UE shall not request the use of eDRX during:

- an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;

- a tracking area updating procedure for the UE attached for emergency
bearer services; or

- an attach for access to RLOS.

The UE and the network may negotiate eDRX parameters during a tracking
area updating procedure when the UE has a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services.

The network accepts the request to use the eDRX by providing the
extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the attach or the tracking
area updating procedure. The UE shall use eDRX only if it received the
extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or tracking area
updating procedure and the UE does not have a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services.

NOTE: If the UE wants to keep using eDRX, the UE includes the extended
DRX parameters IE in each attach or tracking area updating procedure.

If the UE received the extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach
or tracking area updating procedure, upon successful completion of the
PDN disconnect procedure of the PDN connection for emergency bearer
services or EPS bearer context deactivation procedure of the EPS bearer
context for emergency, the UE shall resume eDRX.

If the network has provided the extended DRX parameters IE during the
last attach or tracking area updating procedure, upon successful
completion of the PDN disconnect procedure of the PDN connection for
emergency bearer services or EPS bearer context deactivation procedure
of the EPS bearer context for emergency, the network shall resume eDRX.

If the UE or the network locally releases the PDN connection for
emergency bearer service, the UE or the network shall not use eDRX until
the UE receives eDRX parameters during a tracking area updating
procedure with EPS bearer context synchronization or upon successful
completion of a service request procedure.

If the UE did not receive the extended eDRX parameters IE, or if the UE
has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall use the
stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available.

If the network did not accept the request to use eDRX, or if the UE has
a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the network shall use
the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available.

If the network provided the extended DRX parameters IE and also assigned
a new GUTI for the UE as described in clause 5.5.3.2.4 during the last
tracking area updating procedure, the network shall use the stored UE
specific DRX parameter, if available, with the old GUTI and use the eDRX
provided by the network with the new GUTI until the old GUTI can be
considered as invalid by the network (see clause 5.4.1.4).

5.3.13 Interaction between power saving mode and extended idle mode DRX cycle

The UE can request the use of both PSM and eDRX during an attach or
tracking area updating procedure but it is up to the network to decide
to enable none, one of them or both (see 3GPP TS 23.682 [11A] and
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

If the network accepts the use of both PSM (see clause 5.3.11) and eDRX
(see clause 5.3.12), the extended DRX parameters IE provided to the UE
should allow for multiple paging occasions before the active timer
expires.

5.3.14 Dedicated core network

The network may reject mobility management signalling requests from UEs
due to dedicated core network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. When
the network rejects mobility management signalling requests due to
dedicated core network, the mechanism for general NAS level mobility
management congestion control as specified in clause 5.3.9 shall be
followed.

5.3.15 CIoT EPS optimizations

CIoT EPS optimizations provide improved support of small data and SMS
transfer. A UE supporting CIoT EPS optimizations can indicate the CIoT
network behaviour the UE can support and prefers to use during attach or
tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). The UE may
indicate the support for control plane CIoT EPS optimization, user plane
CIoT EPS optimization, EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, S1-U data
transfer and header compression (see clause 9.9.3.34). The UE may also
request to use SMS transfer without combined attach procedure during the
attach procedure. Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the
indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT EPS
optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization (see clause 9.9.3.0B).
The indication of preference is also considered as the request to use. A
UE supporting CIoT 5GS optimizations can also indicate the 5GS CIoT
network behaviour the UE can support during attach or tracking area
updating procedure. Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the
indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT 5GS
optimization or user plane CIoT 5GS optimization.

NOTE 1: The UE supporting control plane CIoT EPS optimization and S1-U
data transfer but not user plane CIoT EPS optimization does not indicate
preference for user plane CIoT EPS optimization.

The UE can be in NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode when requesting the use of
CIoT EPS optimizations during an attach or tracking area updating
procedure. A UE in NB-S1 mode always indicates support for control plane
CIoT EPS optimization. A UE in NB-S1 mode can also request SMS transfer
without combined procedure by using the normal attach or tracking area
updating procedure (see clause 5.5.1 and 5.5.3).

In NB-S1 mode, the UE, when requesting the use of CIoT EPS optimization,
does not:

- request an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;

- request an attach procedure for initiating a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services with attach type not set to "EPS emergency
attach";

- indicate voice domain preference and UE's usage setting; or

- request an attach for access to RLOS.

The network does not indicate to the UE support of emergency bearer
services when the UE is in NB-S1 mode (see clause 5.5.1.2.4 and
5.5.3.2.4).

The control plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support of efficient
transport of user data (IP, non-IP, Ethernet) or SMS messages over
control plane via the MME without triggering data radio bearer
establishment. The support of control plane CIoT EPS optimization is
mandatory for the network in NB-S1 mode and optional in WB-S1 mode.
Optional header compression of IP data can be applied to IP PDN type PDN
connections that are configured to support header compression.

The user plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support for change from
EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode without the need for using the
service request procedure (see clause 5.3.1.3).

If the UE indicates support of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in
the attach request, the UE may include an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE instead of a
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as part of the attach procedure. If the
EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the network, the
UE and the network can at any time release all the PDN connections and
the UE still remains EPS attached.

NOTE 2: For both the UE and the network, the term "EMM-REGISTERED
without PDN connection" is equivalent to the term "EPS attach without
PDN connectivity" as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE indicates "SMS only" during a normal attach or
tracking area updating procedure, the MME supporting CIoT EPS
optimisations provides SMS so that the UE is not required to perform a
combined attach or tracking area updating procedure.

If the UE supports user plane CIoT EPS optimization, it shall also
support S1-U data transfer.

If the UE indicates support of one or more CIoT EPS optimizations and
the network supports one or more CIoT EPS optimizations and decides to
accept the attach or tracking area update request, the network indicates
the supported CIoT EPS optimizations to the UE per TAI list when
accepting the UE request. Network indication of support is interpreted
by the UE as the acceptance to use the respective feature. After
completion of the attach or tracking area updating procedure, the UE and
the network can then use the accepted CIoT EPS optimizations for the
transfer of user data (IP, non-IP, Ethernet and SMS).

The UE supporting control plane CIoT EPS optimization may indicate
support for control plane MT-EDT during the attach or tracking area
updating procedure. For a UE that supports control plane MT-EDT and for
which the network has accepted the use of control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the network may trigger the delivery of downlink data to
the UE, when available, using procedures for control plane MT-EDT as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

The UE supporting user plane CIoT EPS optimization may indicate support
for user plane MT-EDT during the attach or tracking area updating
procedure. For a UE that supports user plane MT-EDT and for which the
network has accepted the use of user plane CIoT EPS optimization, the
network may trigger the delivery of downlink data to the UE, when
available, using procedures for user plane MT-EDT as specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

If the UE and the network support both the control plane CIoT EPS
optimization and S1-U data transfer, then when receiving the UE's
request for a PDN connection, the MME decides whether the PDN connection
should be SCEF PDN connection or SGi PDN connection as specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]:

- if SCEF PDN connection is to be established for non-IP data type, the
MME shall include Control plane only indication for the requested PDN
connection;

- if SGi PDN connection is to be established and existing SGi PDN
connections for this UE were established with Control plane only
indication, the MME shall include Control plane only indication for the
newly requested SGi PDN connection;

- if SGi PDN connection is to be established and existing SGi PDN
connections for this UE were established without Control plane only
indication, the MME shall not include Control plane only indication for
the newly requested SGi PDN connection; and

- if SGi PDN connection is to be established and no SGi PDN connection
for this UE exists, the MME determine whether to include Control plane
only indication for the requested SGi PDN connection based on local
policies, the UE's preferred CIoT network behaviour and the supported
CIoT network behaviour.

If the network supports user plane CIoT EPS optimization, it shall also
support S1-U data transfer.

Broadcast system information may provide information about support of
CIoT EPS optimizations (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). At reception of new
broadcast system information, the lower layers deliver it to the EMM
layer in the UE. The information provided by lower layers is per PLMN
and used by the UE to determine whether certain CIoT EPS optimizations
are supported in the cell.

The UE shall not attempt to use CIoT EPS optimizations which are
indicated as not supported.

In NB-S1 mode, when the UE requests the lower layer to establish a RRC
connection and the UE requests the use of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection or user plane CIoT EPS optimization, the UE shall pass an
indication of the requested CIoT EPS optimizations to the lower layers.
If the UE requests the use of S1-U data transfer without user plane CIoT
optimization, then the UE shall also pass an indication of user plane
CIoT EPS optimization to lower layers.

In WB-S1 mode, when the UE requests the lower layer to establish a RRC
connection and the UE requests the use of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection, control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT EPS
optimizations to the lower layers.

5.3.16 Restriction on use of enhanced coverage

In order to deal with use of extensive resources from the network, the
operator may prevent specific subscribers from using enhanced coverage
(see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). When in NB-S1 mode, the UE shall indicate
support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage. When in WB-S1 mode,
the UE supporting either CE mode A or CE mode B shall indicate support
for restriction on use of enhanced coverage. The UE supporting
restriction on use of enhanced coverage indicates its support for
restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the ATTACH REQUEST and
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. If the UE supports restriction on
use of enhanced coverage, the MME indicates whether the use of enhanced
coverage is restricted or not in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (see clause 5.5.1.2 and clause 5.5.3.2). If
the use of enhanced coverage is restricted, the UE shall not use
enhanced coverage in the registered PLMN and in any PLMN which is in the
list of equivalent PLMNs.

If the UE supports CE mode B and the network determines that

- the use of enhanced coverage is not restricted for the UE; or

- CE mode B is not restricted for the UE;

the applicable NAS timer values shall be calculated by the network as
described in clause 4.8.

5.3.17 Service Gap Control

The network may control the frequency UEs can transit from EMM-IDLE mode
to EMM-CONNECTED mode via the service gap control (SGC) as specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the network supports service gap control (SGC)
feature and the service gap time value is available in the EMM context
of the UE, the MME shall consider SGC as active for the UE.

The UE and the network negotiate usage of the service gap control (SGC)
feature during the attach and tracking area updating procedures:

- the UE supporting service gap control indicates its support for
service gap control in the ATTACH REQUEST and TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message. If the UE supports service gap control and the SGC is
active for the UE, the MME shall include service gap timer T3447 value
in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
(see clause 5.5.1.2 and clause 5.5.3.2). The UE shall store the service
gap time value; and

- for UEs that do not support the optional SGC feature when the network
rejects mobility management signalling requests due to service gap
control is active in the network, the mechanism for general NAS level
mobility management congestion control as specified in clause 5.3.9
applies.

The UE shall start the SGC timer T3447 when the NAS signalling
connection is released and if:

- the UE supports SGC feature, and the service gap timer value is
available in the UE and does not indicate zero; and

- the NAS signalling connection released was not established for:

- paging;

- attach requests without PDN connection request; or

- tracking area update requests without "active" or "signalling active"
flag set.

If the SGC is active in the network, after the UE transitions from
EMM-CONNECTED mode to EMM-IDLE mode except when the UE was in
EMM-CONNECTED mode due to:

- paging;

- attach requests without PDN connection request; or

- tracking area update requests without "active" or "signalling active"
flag set,

the network shall start the SGC timer T3447:

- with the service gap time value available in the EMM context minus 4
minutes, if the UE supports SGC feature and the service gap time value
has been sent to the UE with a non-zero value; or

- with the service gap time value available in the EMM context if the UE
does not support SGC feature.

When the SGC timer T3447 is running, the network allows:

- requests for emergency bearer services;

- requests for exception data reporting;

- attach requests without PDN connection request;

- tracking area update requests without "active" or "signalling active"
flag set;

- requests from UEs that were received via NAS signalling connections
established with RRC establishment cause "High priority access AC 11 –
15"; and

- mobile terminated service requests triggered by paging and subsequent
MO signalling or MO data, if any, until the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode.

If the MME determines that the UE operating in single-registration mode
has performed an inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode and the
timer T3447 is running in the MME, the MME stops the T3447.

Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, if the UE supports
service gap control, T3447 is running in the UE, and the T3447 value is
included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message received from the MME (see clause 5.5.1.2 and clause 5.5.3.2),
the UE shall keep T3447 running. Additionally, the UE shall store and
replace the currently stored T3447 value with the received T3447 value.
Upon expiry of the running T3447 timer, the UE shall use the new value
when starting T3447 again.

The UE or the network with a running service gap timer shall keep the
timer running when the UE transits from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED
mode.

NOTE: If the UE transitions from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode due
to attach request without PDN connection request or tracking area update
request without "active" or "signalling active" flag set, the UE
initiates no further MO signalling except for tracking area update
request without "active" or "signalling active" flag set until the UE
receives network-initiated signalling (e.g. DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message for MT SMS) or MT data over user plane, or after the UE has
moved to EMM-IDLE state and the service gap timer is not running.

If the timer T3447 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3447 is kept running until it expires.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3447 is running, the UE shall
behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE
remains the same:

- let t1 be the time remaining for T3447 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1.

5.3.18 Restricted local operator services

Restricted local operator services (RLOS) is an optional feature that
enables operators to offer access to restricted local operator services
to the unauthenticated UEs in limited service state (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). Authenticated UEs in limited service state may
also be able to access restricted local operator services. The UE
requests access to RLOS during the attach procedure by setting the
attach type to "EPS RLOS attach" in the ATTACH REQUEST message. Subject
to regulation and local operator policy, if the MME is configured to
support access to RLOS, the MME accepts the UE's attach request
regardless of the authentication result or skips the authentication
procedure.

When the UE requests the lower layer to establish an RRC connection for
access to RLOS, the UE indicates in the RRC signalling that the RRC
connection is for access to RLOS to the lower layers.

The UE supporting access to RLOS shall perform PLMN selection according
to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. Broadcast system information may provide
information about support of access to RLOS (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).
At reception of new broadcast system information, the lower layers
deliver it to the EMM layer in the UE. The information provided by lower
layers is per PLMN and used by the UE to determine whether the PLMN is
configured to support access to RLOS. The UE shall not attempt to
request access to RLOS if the PLMN does not support access to RLOS.

NOTE: Only authorized applications on the UE are allowed to trigger the
initiation of RLOS connection (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

For UE attached for access to RLOS, only UE originated access to RLOS
requests are supported. Mobile terminated access to RLOS request and
network triggered service request are not allowed. The UE is not allowed
to initiate UE requested PDN connectivity for any additional PDN
connection. In addition, intersystem change to other RAT including GERAN
and UTRAN and handover between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are not
supported.

Access to RLOS is applicable to the UEs in WB-S1 mode only. The UEs in
NB-S1 mode shall not request access to RLOS.

Location service does not apply to access to RLOS.

If a UE attached for access to RLOS needs to initiate an emergency call,
the UE shall first perform a local detach prior to initiating an attach
procedure for emergency bearer services.

5.3.19 Core Network selection and redirection for UEs using CIoT optimizations

5.3.19.1 Core network selection

A UE that supports CIoT optimizations performs core network selection as
specified in clause 4.8.4A.1 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

5.3.19.2 Redirection of the UE by the core network

The network that supports CIoT optimizations can redirect a UE between
EPC and 5GCN as specified in clause 5.31.3 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [58]. The
network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability or S1 mode
capability, the CIoT network behaviour supported and preferred by the UE
or the CIoT network behaviour supported by the network to determine the
redirection.

NOTE: It is assumed that the network would avoid redirecting the UE back
and forth between EPC and 5GCN.

The network redirects the UE to 5GCN by rejecting the attach request, or
tracking area update request, or service request with the EMM cause #31
"Redirection to 5GCN required" as specified in
clause 5.5.1.2.5, 5.5.1.3.5, 5.5.3.2.5, 5.5.3.3.5 and 5.6.1.5. Upon
receipt of reject message, the UE disables the E-UTRA capability as
specified in clause 4.5 and enables the N1 mode capability if it was
disabled in order to move to 5GCN.

The network that supports CIoT optimizations can also redirect a UE from
5GCN to EPC as specified in clause 4.8.4A.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

5.3.20 UE radio capability signalling optimisation

UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) is a feature that is
optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the
transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). RACS works by assigning an identifier to represent
a set of UE radio capabilities. This identifier is called the UE radio
capability ID. A UE radio capability ID can be either
manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned. The UE radio capability ID is
an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container
over the radio interface.

In this release of the specification, RACS is not applicable to NB-S1
mode.

If the UE supports RACS:

- the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to
"RACS supported" in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST
and TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST messages;

- if the UE performs an attach procedure and the UE has an applicable UE
radio capability ID for the current UE radio configuration in the
selected network, the UE shall include the UE radio capability ID
availability IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message and set the IE to "UE
radio capability ID available";

- if the UE performs a tracking area updating procedure and the UE has
an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio
configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE radio
capability ID availability IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message and set the IE to "UE radio capability ID available";

- If the UE is requested to provide the UE radio capability ID by the
network during a security mode control procedure, the UE shall include
the UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE of the
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message according to the rules in clause
5.4.3.3.;

- if the radio configuration at the UE changes (for instance because the
UE has disabled a specific radio capability) then:

a) if the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE
radio configuration, the UE shall initiate a tracking area updating
procedure, include a UE radio capability information update needed IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and set the URCIDA bit to "UE
radio capability ID available" in the UE radio capability ID
availability IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message; and

b) if the UE does not have an applicable UE radio capability ID for the
new UE radio configuration, the UE shall initiate a tracking area
updating procedure and shall include a UE radio capability information
update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message;

NOTE: Performing the tracking area updating procedure with the UE radio
capability information update needed IE included in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message and without the UE radio capability ID
availability IE set to "UE radio capability ID available" in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as specified in b) above can
trigger the network to assign a new UE radio capability ID to the UE.

- upon receiving a network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or in the
GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the UE shall store the
network-assigned UE radio capability ID and the PLMN ID of the serving
network along with a mapping to the current UE radio configuration in
its non-volatile memory as specified in annex C. The UE shall be able to
store at least the last 16 received network-assigned UE radio capability
IDs with the associated PLMN ID and the mapping to the corresponding UE
radio configuration;

- the UE shall not use a network-assigned UE radio capability ID in
PLMNs equivalent to the PLMN which assigned it; and

- upon receiving a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to
"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested" in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or in
the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the UE shall delete all
network-assigned UE radio capability IDs stored at the UE for the
serving network and initiate a tracking area updating procedure. If the
UE has an applicable manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID for
the current UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall
include a UE radio capability ID availability IE set to "UE radio
capability ID available" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

If the network supports RACS:

- if the UE has included the UE radio capability ID availability IE in
the ATTACH REQUEST message and set the IE to "UE radio capability ID
available", the network shall initiate a security mode control procedure
to retrieve the UE radio capability ID from the UE;

- if the UE has included the UE radio capability ID availability IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and set the IE to "UE radio
capability ID available", the network may initiate a security mode
control procedure to retrieve the UE radio capability ID from the UE;

- if the UE has included the UE radio capability ID availability IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, set the URCIDA bit to "UE
radio capability ID available" in the UE radio capability ID
availability IE and no UE radio capability ID is available in the UE
context in the MME, the network shall initiate a security mode control
procedure to retrieve the UE radio capability ID from the UE;

- the network may assign a network-assigned UE radio capability ID to a
UE which supports RACS by including a UE radio capability ID IE in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or in
the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message; and

- the network may trigger the UE to delete all network-assigned UE radio
capability IDs stored at the UE for the serving network by including a
UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to "Network-assigned
UE radio capability IDs deletion requested" in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or in the GUTI
REALLOCATION COMMAND message.

5.3.21 Wake-up signal assistance

A UE supporting wake-up signal (WUS) assistance can indicate its WUS
assistance capability during attach or tracking area updating procedure
(see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). The UE supporting WUS assistance may include
its UE paging probability information in the Requested WUS assistance
information IE during an attach or tracking area updating procedure (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]). The UE shall not include its UE paging probability
information during:

- an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;

- an attach procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach";

- a tracking area updating procedure for initiating a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services; or.

- a tracking area updating procedure when the UE has a PDN connection
established for emergency bearer services.

The UE and the network may negotiate the UE paging probability
information during an attach or tracking area updating procedure when
the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services. The UE paging
probability information is an assistance information used to determine
the WUS group for paging UE (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10],
3GPP TS 36.300 [20]).

NOTE: The determination of UE paging probability information is up to UE
implementation.

If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and the network
accepts the use of the WUS assistance for the UE, the network determines
the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE based on the
requested UE paging probability information, if any, local configuration
or previous statistical information for the UE, and then indicates the
negotiated UE paging probability information in the Negotiated WUS
assistance information IE to the UE when accepting the attach or the
tracking area updating procedure. The network shall store the negotiated
UE paging probability information in the EMM context of the UE for
paging.

The UE shall use WUS assistance only if it received the Negotiated WUS
assistance information IE during the last attach or tracking area
updating procedure. If the UE did not receive the Negotiated WUS
assistance information IE during the last attach or tracking area
updating procedure, the UE shall delete any existing WUS assistance
information received from the network.

If the network did not accept the request to use WUS assistance, the
network shall delete the stored negotiated UE paging probability
information for the UE, if available.

When a PDN connection for emergency bearer service is successfully
established after the UE received the Negotiated WUS assistance
information IE during the last attach or tracking area updating
procedure, the UE and the network shall not use WUS assistance
information until:

- the successful completion of the PDN disconnect procedure of the PDN
connection for emergency bearer services or EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure of the EPS bearer context for emergency, or

- the UE receives WUS assistance information during a tracking area
updating procedure with EPS bearer context synchronization or upon
successful completion of a service request procedure, if the UE or the
network locally releases the PDN connection for emergency bearer
service.

5.4 EMM common procedures

5.4.1 GUTI reallocation procedure

5.4.1.1 General

The purpose of the GUTI reallocation procedure is to allocate a GUTI and
optionally to provide one or more of the following to a particular UE:

- a new TAI list;

- a new DCN-ID; and

- in WB-S1 mode, if the UE supports RACS, either a UE radio capability
ID deletion indication or a UE radio capability ID.

The reallocation of a GUTI is performed by the unique procedure defined
in this clause. This procedure can only be initiated by the MME in state
EMM-REGISTERED.

The GUTI can also be implicitly reallocated at attach or tracking area
updating procedures. The implicit reallocation of a GUTI is described in
the clauses which specify these procedures (see clause 5.5.1 and 5.5.3).

The PLMN identity in the GUTI indicates the current registered PLMN.

NOTE 1: The GUTI reallocation procedure is usually performed in ciphered
mode.

NOTE 2: Normally, the GUTI reallocation will take place in conjunction
with another mobility management procedure, e.g. as part of tracking
area updating.

5.4.1.2 GUTI reallocation initiation by the network

The MME shall initiate the GUTI reallocation procedure by sending a GUTI
REALLOCATION COMMAND message to the UE and starting the timer T3450 (see
example in figure 5.4.1.2.1).

The GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message shall include a GUTI and may
include one or more of the following:

- a TAI list;

- a DCN-ID; and

- in WB-S1 mode, if the UE supports RACS, either a UE radio capability
ID deletion indication or a UE radio capability ID.

[]

Figure 5.4.1.2.1: GUTI reallocation procedure

5.4.1.3 GUTI reallocation completion by the UE

Upon receipt of the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the UE shall:

- store the GUTI;

- store the TAI list, if provided;

- store the DCN-ID, if provided;

- in WB-S1 mode, if the UE supports RACS and the GUTI REALLOCATION
COMMAND message includes:

a) a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to
"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested", delete
any network-assigned UE radio capability IDs associated with the
registered PLMN stored at the UE, then the UE shall, after the
completion of the ongoing GUTI reallocation procedure, initiate a
tracking area updating procedure as specified in clause 5.5.3. If the UE
has an applicable manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID for the
current UE radio configuration, the UE shall include the UE radio
capability ID availability IE set to "UE radio capability ID available"
in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message; or

b) a UE radio capability ID IE, store the UE radio capability ID as
specified in annex C; and

- send a GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message to the MME.

The UE considers the new GUTI as valid and the old GUTI as invalid. If
the UE receives a new TAI list in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message,
the UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as
invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as valid.

If the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message contains the DCN-ID IE, then
the UE shall store the included DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code
of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the
ME as specified in annex C.

5.4.1.4 GUTI reallocation completion by the network

Upon receipt of the GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message, the MME shall
stop the timer T3450 and consider the new GUTI as valid and the old GUTI
as invalid. If a new TAI list is provided in the GUTI REALLOCATION
COMMAND message, the MME shall consider the new TAI list as valid and
the old TAI list as invalid.

5.4.1.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Transmission failure of GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message indication
with TAI change from lower layers

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the GUTI reallocation
procedure shall be aborted and a tracking area updating procedure shall
be initiated.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE
implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the
GUTI reallocation procedure.

b) Transmission failure of GUTI REALLOCATION COMPLETE message indication
without TAI change from lower layers

It is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure
that triggered the GUTI reallocation procedure.

5.4.1.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Lower layer failure

If a lower layer failure is detected before the GUTI REALLOCATION
COMPLETE message is received, the old and the new GUTI shall be
considered as valid until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by
the network. If a new TAI list was provided in the GUTI REALLOCATION
COMMAND message, the old and new TAI list shall also be considered as
valid until the old TAI list can be considered as invalid by the
network.

During this period the network:

- may first use the old S-TMSI from the old GUTI for paging within the
area defined by the old TAI list for an implementation dependent number
of paging attempts for network originated transactions. If a new TAI
list was provided with old GUTI in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND
message, the new TAI list should also be used for paging. Upon response
from the UE, the network may re-initiate the GUTI reallocation. If the
response is received from a tracking area within the old and new TAI
list, the network shall re-initiate the GUTI reallocation. If no
response is received to the paging attempts, the network may use the new
S-TMSI from the new GUTI for paging for an implementation dependent
number of paging attempts. In this case, if a new TAI list was provided
with new GUTI in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the new TAI list
shall be used instead of the old TAI list. Upon response from the UE the
network shall consider the new GUTI as valid and the old GUTI as
invalid. If no response is received to the paging attempts, the network
may use the IMSI for paging for an implementation dependent number of
paging attempts;

NOTE 1: Paging with IMSI causes the UE to re-attach as described in
clause 5.6.2.2.2.

- shall consider the new GUTI as valid if it is used by the UE and,
additionally, the new TAI list as valid if it was provided with this
GUTI in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message;

- may use the identification procedure followed by a new GUTI
reallocation if the UE uses the old GUTI; and

- if the network accepted to use eDRX for the UE, may determine the next
paging window from both old GUTI and new GUTI, and may first use the
S-TMSI from the GUTI which led the first eDRX for paging. If no response
is received to the paging attempts for the first eDRX, the network may
use the other S-TMSI from the other GUTI which led the second eDRX for
paging. For this paging procedure, the network shall start timer T3415
long enough to care the paging attempts for both eDRXs.

NOTE 2: If the second eDRX comes during the first eDRX ongoing, the
paging attempts for the second eDRX can be initiated with stopping
further paging attempts for the first eDRX.

b) Expiry of timer T3450

The GUTI reallocation procedure is supervised by the timer T3450. The
network shall, on the first expiry of timer T3450, reset and restart
timer T3450 and shall retransmit the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND. This
retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
T3450, the network shall abort the reallocation procedure and shall
follow the rules described for case a above.

c) GUTI reallocation and attach procedure collision

If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing
GUTI reallocation procedure has been completed the network shall proceed
with the attach procedure after deletion of the EMM context.

d) GUTI reallocation and UE initiated detach procedure collision

If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing GUTI
reallocation procedure has been completed, the network shall abort the
GUTI reallocation procedure and shall progress the detach procedure.

e) GUTI reallocation and tracking area updating procedure collision

If the network receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before
the ongoing GUTI reallocation procedure has been completed, the network
shall abort the GUTI reallocation procedure and shall progress the
tracking area updating procedure. The network may then perform a new
GUTI reallocation.

f) GUTI reallocation and service request procedure collision

If the network receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for CS
fallback or 1xCS fallback before the ongoing GUTI reallocation procedure
has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

g) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

If the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message could not be delivered due to
an intra MME handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list,
then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall
retransmit the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message. If a failure of the
handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling
connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the GUTI REALLOCATION
COMMAND message.

If there is a different new GUTI and optionally a new TAI list included
in a subsequent GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the UE always regards
the newest GUTI and the newest TAI list as valid for the recovery time.

5.4.2 Authentication procedure

5.4.2.1 General

The purpose of the EPS authentication and key agreement (AKA) procedure
is to provide mutual authentication between the user and the network and
to agree on a key K_(ASME) (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]). The cases when the
EPS AKA procedure should be used are defined in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

The EPS AKA procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network.
However, the UE can reject the EPS authentication challenge sent by the
network.

The UE shall proceed with an EPS authentication challenge only if a USIM
is present.

A partial native EPS security context is established in the UE and the
network when an EPS authentication is successfully performed. During a
successful EPS authentication procedure, the CK and IK are computed by
the USIM. CK and IK are then used by the ME as key material to compute a
new key, K_(ASME). K_(ASME) is stored in the EPS security contexts (see
3GPP TS 33.401 [19]) of both the network and in the volatile memory of
the ME while attached to the network, and is the root for the EPS
integrity protection and ciphering key hierarchy.

5.4.2.2 Authentication initiation by the network

When a NAS signalling connection exists, the network can initiate an
authentication procedure at any time. For restrictions applicable after
handover or inter-system handover to S1 mode see clause 5.5.3.2.3.

The network initiates the authentication procedure by sending an
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE and starting the timer T3460
(see example in figure 5.4.2.2.1). The AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message
contains the parameters necessary to calculate the authentication
response (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

If an eKSI is contained in an initial NAS message during an EMM
procedure, the network shall include a different eKSI value in the
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message when it initiates an authentication
procedure.

[]

Figure 5.4.2.2.1: Authentication procedure

5.4.2.3 Authentication response by the UE

The UE shall respond to an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. With the
exception of the cases described in clauses 5.4.2.6 and 5.4.2.7 case k,
the UE shall process the authentication challenge data and respond with
an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network.

Upon a successful EPS authentication challenge, the UE shall determine
the PLMN identity to be used for the calculation of the new K_(ASME)
from the authentication challenge data according to the following rules:

a) When the UE moves from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode, until the
first handover, the UE shall use the PLMN identity of the selected PLMN;
and

b) After handover or inter-system handover to S1 mode,

- if the target cell is not a shared network cell, the UE shall use the
PLMN identity received as part of the broadcast system information;

- if the target cell is a shared network cell and the UE has a valid
GUTI, the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the GUTI; and

- if the target cell is a shared network cell, the UE does not have a
valid GUTI and,

- the EPS authentication challenge is performed after inter-system
handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode and the UE
has a valid P-TMSI and RAI, the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is
part of the RAI; or

- the EPS authentication challenge is performed after inter-system
handover from N1 mode to S1 mode and the UE has a valid 5G-GUTI, the UE
shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the 5G-GUTI.

Upon a successful EPS authentication challenge, the new K_(ASME)
calculated from the authentication challenge data shall be stored in a
new EPS security context in the volatile memory of the ME.

The USIM will compute the authentication response (RES) using the
authentication challenge data received from the ME, and pass RES to the
ME.

In order to avoid a synchronisation failure, when the UE receives an
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the UE shall store the received RAND
together with the RES returned from the USIM in the volatile memory of
the ME. When the UE receives a subsequent AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message, if the stored RAND value is equal to the new received value in
the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, then the ME shall not pass the RAND
to the USIM, but shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with the
stored RES. If there is no valid stored RAND in the ME or the stored
RAND is different from the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message, the ME shall pass the RAND to the USIM, shall override
any previously stored RAND and RES with the new ones and start, or reset
and restart timer T3416.

The RAND and RES values stored in the ME shall be deleted and timer
T3416, if running, shall be stopped:

- upon receipt of a

- SECURITY MODE COMMAND,

- SERVICE REJECT,

- SERVICE ACCEPT,

- TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT,

- TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT, or

- AUTHENTICATION REJECT message;

- upon expiry of timer T3416;

- if the UE enters the EMM state EMM-DEREGISTERED or EMM-NULL; or

- if the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode.

5.4.2.4 Authentication completion by the network

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the network stops
the timer T3460 and checks the correctness of RES (see
3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

If the authentication procedure has been completed successfully and the
related eKSI is stored in the EPS security context of the network, the
network shall include a different eKSI value in the AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message when it initiates a new authentication procedure.

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, the network stops the
timer T3460. In the case where the EMM cause #21 "synch failure" is
received, the core network may renegotiate with the HSS/AuC and provide
the UE with new authentication parameters.

5.4.2.5 Authentication not accepted by the network

If the authentication response (RES) returned by the UE is not valid,
the network response depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in
the initial NAS message, that is:

- if the GUTI was used; or

- if the IMSI was used.

If the GUTI was used, the network should initiate an identification
procedure. If the IMSI given by the UE during the identification
procedure differs from the IMSI the network had associated with the
GUTI, the authentication should be restarted with the correct
parameters. Otherwise, if the IMSI provided by the UE is the same as the
IMSI stored in the network (i.e. authentication has really failed), the
network should send an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE.

If the IMSI was used for identification in the initial NAS message, or
the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure after
an unsuccessful authentication procedure, the network should send an
AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE. The network shall maintain, if
any, the EMM-context and EPS security context unchanged.

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message,

a) if the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS,
the UE shall set the update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete
the stored GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and KSI_(ASME).
The USIM shall be considered invalid until switching off the UE or the
UICC containing the USIM is removed. If the UE maintains a counter for
"SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set
this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If the UE
maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS
services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE
implementation-specific maximum value.

If A/Gb or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI
signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the MM
parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the authentication
and ciphering procedure is not accepted by the network.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status,
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the authentication procedure
performed over 3GPP access is not accepted by the network; and

b) if the message is received without integrity protection and if timer
T3416, T3418 or T3420 is running, the UE shall start timer T3247 (see
3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) with a random value uniformly drawn from the range
between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is not running (see
clause 5.3.7b). Additionally, the UE shall:

- if the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for
GPRS services" events and the counter has a value less than a UE
implementation-specific maximum value, proceed as specified in
clause 5.3.7b, list item 1a for the case that the EMM cause value
received is #3; and

- otherwise proceed as specified under list item a above for the case
that the message has been successfully integrity checked.

If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the UE, the UE shall
abort any EMM signalling procedure, stop any of the timers T3410, T3416,
T3417, T3430, T3421, T3418 or T3420 (if they were running) and enter
state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency
bearer services, if the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services established or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services, the MME need not follow the procedures specified for
the authentication failure in the present clause. The MME may continue a
current EMM specific procedure or PDN connectivity request procedure.
Upon completion of the authentication procedure, if not initiated as
part of another procedure, or upon completion of the EMM procedure or
PDN connectivity request procedure, the MME shall deactivate all
non-emergency EPS bearers, if any, by initiating an EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure. The network shall consider the UE to be attached
for emergency bearer services only.

Depending on local regulation and operator policy, if the UE is
requesting attach for access to RLOS, the MME need not follow the
procedures specified for the authentication failure in the present
clause. The MME may continue a current EMM specific procedure.

5.4.2.6 Authentication not accepted by the UE

In an EPS authentication challenge, the UE shall check the authenticity
of the core network by means of the AUTN parameter received in the
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. This enables the UE to detect a false
network.

During an EPS authentication procedure, the UE may reject the core
network due to an incorrect AUTN parameter (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).
This parameter contains three possible causes for authentication
failure:

a) MAC code failure:

If the UE finds the MAC code (supplied by the core network in the AUTN
parameter) to be invalid, the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE
message to the network, with the EMM cause #20 "MAC failure". The UE
shall then follow the procedure described in clause 5.4.2.7, item c.

b) Non-EPS authentication unacceptable:

If the UE finds that the "separation bit" in the AMF field of AUTN
supplied by the core network is 0, the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION
FAILURE message to the network, with the EMM cause #26 "non-EPS
authentication unacceptable" (see clause 6.1.1 in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).
The UE shall then follow the procedure described in clause 5.4.2.7, item
d.

c) SQN failure:

If the UE finds the SQN (supplied by the core network in the AUTN
parameter) to be out of range, the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION
FAILURE message to the network, with the EMM cause #21 "synch failure"
and a re-synchronization token AUTS provided by the USIM (see
3GPP TS 33.102 [18]). The UE shall then follow the procedure described
in clause 5.4.2.7, item e.

If the UE returns an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, the
UE shall delete any previously stored RAND and RES and shall stop timer
T3416, if running.

If the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established
or is establishing such a PDN connection, additional UE requirements are
specified in clause 5.4.2.7, under "for items c, d, e".

If the UE is attached for access to RLOS and has a PDN connection for
RLOS established or is establishing such a PDN connection, additional UE
requirements are specified in clause 5.4.2.7, under "for items c, d, e".

5.4.2.7 Abnormal cases

a) Lower layer failure:

Upon detection of lower layer failure before the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE
message is received, the network shall abort the procedure.

b) Expiry of timer T3460:

The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3460, retransmit
the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer
T3460. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth
expiry of timer T3460, the network shall abort the authentication
procedure and any ongoing EMM specific procedure and release the NAS
signalling connection.

c) Authentication failure (EMM cause #20 "MAC failure"):

The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with EMM cause #20
"MAC failure" according to clause 5.4.2.6, to the network and start
timer T3418 (see example in figure 5.4.2.7.1). Furthermore, the UE shall
stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3410,
T3417, T3421 or T3430). Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION
FAILURE message from the UE with EMM cause #20 "MAC failure", the
network may initiate the identification procedure described in
clause 5.4.4. This is to allow the network to obtain the IMSI from the
UE. The network may then check that the GUTI originally used in the
authentication challenge corresponded to the correct IMSI. Upon receipt
of the IDENTITY REQUEST message from the network, the UE shall send the
IDENTITY RESPONSE message.

NOTE 1: Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE
with EMM cause #20 "MAC failure", the network may also terminate the
authentication procedure (see clause 5.4.2.5).

If the GUTI/IMSI mapping in the network was incorrect, the network
should respond by sending a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the
UE. Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message from the
network, the UE shall stop the timer T3418, if running, and then process
the challenge information as normal. If the GUTI/IMSI mapping in the
network was correct, the network should terminate the authentication
procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message (see
clause 5.4.2.5).

If the network is validated successfully (an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message that contains a valid SQN and MAC is received), the UE shall
send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and shall start
any retransmission timers (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or T3430) if they
were running and stopped when the UE received the first failed
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.

If the UE receives the second AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message while T3418
is running, and the MAC value cannot be resolved, the UE shall follow
the procedure specified in this clause, item c, starting again from the
beginning, or if the message contains a UMTS authentication challenge,
the UE shall follow the procedure specified in item d. If the SQN is
invalid, the UE shall proceed as specified in item e.

[]

Figure 5.4.2.7.1: Authentication failure procedure (EMM cause #20 "MAC
failure" or
#26 "non-EPS authentication unacceptable")

d) Authentication failure (EMM cause #26 "non-EPS authentication
unacceptable"):

The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with EMM cause #26
"non-EPS authentication unacceptable", to the network and start the
timer T3418 (see example in figure 5.4.2.7.1). Furthermore, the UE shall
stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3410,
T3417, T3421 or T3430). Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION
FAILURE message from the UE with EMM cause #26 "non-EPS authentication
unacceptable", the network may initiate the identification procedure
described in clause 5.4.4. This is to allow the network to obtain the
IMSI from the UE. The network may then check that the GUTI originally
used in the authentication challenge corresponded to the correct IMSI.
Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message from the network, the UE
shall send the IDENTITY RESPONSE message.

NOTE 2: Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE
with EMM cause #26 "non-EPS authentication unacceptable", the network
may also terminate the authentication procedure (see clause 5.4.2.5).

If the GUTI/IMSI mapping in the network was incorrect, the network
should respond by sending a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the
UE. Upon receiving the new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message from the
network, the UE shall stop the timer T3418, if running, and then process
the challenge information as normal. If the GUTI/IMSI mapping in the
network was correct, the network should terminate the authentication
procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message (see
clause 5.4.2.5).

e) Authentication failure (EMM cause #21 "synch failure"):

The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with EMM cause #21
"synch failure", to the network and start the timer T3420 (see example
in figure 5.4.2.7.2). Furthermore, the UE shall stop any of the
retransmission timers that are running (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or
T3430). Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from
the UE with the EMM cause #21 "synch failure", the network shall use the
returned AUTS parameter from the authentication failure parameter IE in
the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, to re-synchronise. The
re-synchronisation procedure requires the MME to delete all unused
authentication vectors for that IMSI and obtain new vectors from the
HSS. When re-synchronisation is complete, the network shall initiate the
authentication procedure. Upon receipt of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message, the UE shall stop the timer T3420, if running.

NOTE 3: Upon receipt of two consecutive AUTHENTICATION FAILURE messages
from the UE with EMM cause #21 "synch failure", the network may
terminate the authentication procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION
REJECT message.

If the network is validated successfully (a new AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message is received which contains a valid SQN and MAC) while T3420 is
running, the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the
network and shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3410, T3417,
T3421 or T3430), if they were running and stopped when the UE received
the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.

If the UE receives the second AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message while T3420
is running, and the MAC value cannot be resolved, the UE shall follow
the procedure specified in item c or if the message contains a UMTS
authentication challenge, the UE shall proceed as specified in item d;
if the SQN is invalid, the UE shall follow the procedure specified in
this clause, item e, starting again from the beginning.

[]

Figure 5.4.2.7.2: Authentication failure procedure (EMM cause #21 "synch
failure")

Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, the UE shall perform
the actions as specified in clause 5.4.2.5.

f) Network failing the authentication check:

If the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check,
then it shall request RRC to locally release the RRC connection and
treat the active cell as barred (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]). The UE shall
start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421 or T3430), if
they were running and stopped when the UE received the first
AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message containing an incorrect authentication
challenge data causing the authentication failure.

g) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication from lower layers (if the
authentication procedure is triggered by a tracking area updating
procedure or an attach procedure)

The UE shall stop any of the timers T3418 and T3420, if running, and
re-initiate the tracking area updating procedure if the authentication
procedure is triggered by a tracking area updating procedure.

The UE shall stop any of the timers T3418 and T3420, if running, and
re-initiate the attach procedure if the authentication procedure is
triggered by an attach procedure.

h) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication with TAI change from lower
layers (if the authentication procedure is triggered by a service
request procedure)

The UE shall stop any of the timers T3418 and T3420, if running.

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the authentication procedure
shall be aborted and a tracking area updating procedure shall be
initiated.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE
implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the
authentication procedure.

i) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or
AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication without TAI change from lower
layers (if the authentication procedure is triggered by a service
request procedure)

The UE shall stop any of the timers T3418 and T3420, if running. It is
up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that
triggered the authentication procedure.

j) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

If the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an
intra MME handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then
upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall
retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. If a failure of handover
procedure is reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling
connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message.

k) Change of cell into a new tracking area

If the UE detects the current TAI is not in the TAI list occurs before
the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message is sent, the UE may discard sending
the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and continue with the
initiation of tracking area updating procedure as described in
clause 5.5.3.

l) AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received without integrity
protection and none of the timers T3416, T3418 and T3420 is running

If an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received and if none of the
timers T3416, T3418 and T3420 is running, then the UE shall discard the
AUTHENTICATION REJECT message. Additionally, the UE may request RRC to
locally release the RRC connection and treat the active cell as barred
(see 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]).

For items c, d, and e if the UE does not have a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services established, is not establishing a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, does not have a PDN connection
for RLOS established and is not establishing a PDN connection for RLOS:

The UE shall stop any of the timers T3418 and T3420, if running, and the
UE enters EMM-IDLE mode, e.g. upon detection of a lower layer failure,
release of the NAS signalling connection, or as the result of an
inter-system handover to A/Gb mode, Iu mode or N1 mode.

The UE shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check
or that the source of the authentication challenge is not genuine and
proceed as described in item f if any of the following occurs:

- the timer T3418 or T3420 expires;

- the UE detects any combination of the authentication failures: EMM
cause #20 "MAC failure", #21 "synch failure", or #26 "non-EPS
authentication unacceptable", during three consecutive authentication
challenges. The authentication challenges shall be considered as
consecutive only if the authentication challenges causing the second and
third authentication failure are received by the UE while the timer
T3418 or T3420 started after the previous authentication failure is
running.

For items c, d, and e if the UE has a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services established, is establishing a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services, has a PDN connection for RLOS established, or
is establishing a PDN connection for RLOS:

1) The UE shall stop any of the timers T3418 and T3420, if running, and
the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode, e.g. upon detection of a lower layer
failure, release of the NAS signalling connection, or as the result of
an inter-system handover to A/Gb mode, Iu mode or N1 mode.

2) Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency
bearer services, if the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services established or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services, the MME need not follow the procedures specified for
the authentication failure specified in the present clause. The MME may
respond to the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message by initiating the security
mode control procedure selecting the "null integrity protection
algorithm" EIA0, "null ciphering algorithm" EEA0 or may abort the
authentication procedure and continue using the current security
context, if any. The MME shall deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer
contexts, if any, by initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation
procedure. If there is an ongoing PDN connectivity procedure, the MME
shall deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts upon completion
of the PDN connectivity procedure. The network shall consider the UE to
be attached for emergency bearer services only.

If a UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established
or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services and
sends an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the MME with the EMM cause
appropriate for these cases (#20, #21, or #26, respectively) and
receives the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message before the timeout of timer
T3418 or T3420, the UE shall deem that the network has passed the
authentication check successfully, stop timer T3418 or T3420,
respectively, and execute the security mode control procedure.

If a UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established
or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services when
timer T3418 or T3420 expires, the UE shall not deem that the network has
failed the authentication check and not behave as described in item f.
Instead the UE shall continue using the current security context, if
any, deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts, if any, by
initiating UE requested PDN disconnect procedure. If there is an ongoing
PDN connectivity procedure, the UE shall deactivate all non-emergency
EPS bearer contexts upon completion of the PDN connectivity procedure.

The UE shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421
or T3430) if:

- they were running and stopped when the UE received the AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message and detected an authentication failure; and

- the procedures associated with these timers have not yet been
completed.

The UE shall consider itself to be attached for emergency bearer
services only.

3) Depending on local regulation and operator policy, if the UE has a
PDN connection for RLOS established or is establishing a PDN connection
for RLOS, the MME need not follow the procedures specified for the
authentication failure specified in the present clause. The MME may
respond to the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message by initiating the security
mode control procedure selecting the "null integrity protection
algorithm" EIA0, "null ciphering algorithm" EEA0 or may abort the
authentication procedure and continue using the current security
context, if any. The network shall consider the UE to be attached for
access to RLOS.

If a UE has a PDN connection for RLOS established or is establishing a
PDN connection for RLOS and sends an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to
the MME with the EMM cause appropriate for these cases (#20, #21, or
#26, respectively) and receives the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message before
the timeout of timer T3418 or T3420, the UE shall deem that the network
has passed the authentication check successfully, stop timer T3418 or
T3420, respectively, and execute the security mode control procedure.

If a UE has a PDN connection for RLOS established or is establishing a
PDN connection for RLOS when timer T3418 or T3420 expires, the UE shall
not deem that the network has failed the authentication check and not
behave as described in item f. Instead the UE shall continue using the
current security context, if any.

The UE shall start any retransmission timers (e.g. T3410, T3417, T3421
or T3430) if:

- they were running and stopped when the UE received the AUTHENTICATION
REQUEST message and detected an authentication failure; and

- the procedures associated with these timers have not yet been
completed.

The UE shall consider itself to be attached for access to RLOS.

5.4.3 Security mode control procedure

5.4.3.1 General

The purpose of the NAS security mode control procedure is to take an EPS
security context into use, and initialise and start NAS signalling
security between the UE and the MME with the corresponding EPS NAS keys
and EPS security algorithms.

Furthermore, the network may also initiate the security mode control
procedure in the following cases:

- in order to change the NAS security algorithms for a current EPS
security context already in use;

- in order to change the value of uplink NAS COUNT used in the latest
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in
3GPP TS 33.401 [19], clause 7.2.9.2; and

- in order to request the UE radio capability ID from the UE.

For restrictions concerning the concurrent running of a security mode
control procedure with other security related procedures in the AS or
inside the core network see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19], clause 7.2.10.

5.4.3.2 NAS security mode control initiation by the network

The MME initiates the NAS security mode control procedure by sending a
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the UE and starting timer T3460 (see
example in figure 5.4.3.2.1).

The MME shall reset the downlink NAS COUNT counter and use it to
integrity protect the initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message if the
security mode control procedure is initiated:

- to take into use the EPS security context created after a successful
execution of the EPS authentication procedure;

- upon receipt of TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including a GPRS
ciphering key sequence number IE, if the MME wishes to create a mapped
EPS security context (i.e. the type of security context flag is set to
"mapped security context" in the NAS key set identifier IE included in
the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message).

The MME shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message unciphered, but
shall integrity protect the message with the NAS integrity key based on
K_(ASME) or mapped K'_(ASME) indicated by the eKSI included in the
message. The MME shall set the security header type of the message to
"integrity protected with new EPS security context".

The MME shall create a locally generated K_(ASME) and send the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message including a KSI value in the NAS key set identifier
IE set to "000" and EIA0 and EEA0 as the selected NAS security
algorithms only when the security mode control procedure is initiated:

- during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services if no shared
EPS security context is available;

- during an attach procedure for access to RLOS if no valid EPS security
context is available;

- during a tracking area updating procedure for a UE that has a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services if no shared EPS security
context is available;

- during a tracking area updating procedure for a UE that has a PDN
connection for access to RLOS if no valid EPS security context is
available;

- during a service request procedure for a UE that has a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services if no shared EPS security context is
available;

- during a service request procedure for a UE that has a PDN connection
for access to RLOS if no valid EPS security context is available;

- after a failed authentication procedure for a UE that has a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services or that is establishing a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, if continued usage of a shared
security context is not possible; or

- after a failed authentication procedure for a UE that has a PDN
connection for access to RLOS or that is establishing a PDN connection
for access to RLOS, if continued usage of a valid security context is
not possible.

The UE shall process a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including a KSI
value in the NAS key set identifier IE set to "000" and EIA0 and EEA0 as
the selected NAS security algorithms and, if accepted, create a locally
generated K_(ASME) when the security mode control procedure is
initiated:

- during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services;

- during an attach procedure for access to RLOS;

- during a tracking area updating procedure when the UE has a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services;

- during a tracking area updating procedure when the UE has a PDN
connection for access to RLOS;

- during a service request procedure when the UE has a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services;

- during a service request procedure when the UE has a PDN connection
for access to RLOS;

- after an authentication procedure when the UE has a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services or is establishing a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services; or

- after an authentication procedure when the UE has a PDN connection for
access to RLOS or is establishing a PDN connection for access to RLOS.

NOTE 1: The process for creation of the locally generated K_(ASME) by
the MME and the UE is implementation dependent.

Upon receipt of a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message including a GPRS
ciphering key sequence number IE, if the MME does not have the valid
current EPS security context indicated by the UE, the MME shall either:

- indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE by
setting the type of security context flag in the NAS key set identifier
IE to "mapped security context" and the KSI value related to the
security context of the source system; or

- set the KSI value "000" in the NAS key set identifier IE if the MME
sets EIA0 and EEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms for a UE that
has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

While having a current mapped EPS security context with the UE, if the
MME wants to take the native EPS security context into use, the MME
shall include the eKSI that indicates the native EPS security context in
the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.

The MME shall include the replayed security capabilities of the UE
(including the security capabilities with regard to NAS, RRC and UP
(user plane) ciphering as well as NAS and RRC integrity, and other
possible target network security capabilities, i.e. UTRAN/GERAN if the
UE included them in the message to network), the replayed nonce_(UE)
when creating a mapped EPS security context and if the UE included it in
the message to the network, the selected NAS ciphering and integrity
algorithms and the Key Set Identifier (eKSI). If the MME supports
handling of UE additional security capabilities and the UE included a UE
additional security capability IE in the message to the network, the MME
shall include the replayed additional security capabilities of the UE.

The MME shall include both the nonce_(MME) and the nonce_(UE) when
creating a mapped EPS security context during inter-system change from
A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode.

The MME may initiate a SECURITY MODE COMMAND in order to change the NAS
security algorithms for a current EPS security context already in use.
The MME re-derives the NAS keys from K_(ASME) with the new NAS algorithm
identities as input and provides the new NAS algorithm identities within
the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message. The MME shall set the security header
type of the message to "integrity protected with new EPS security
context".

If, during an ongoing attach or tracking area updating procedure, the
MME is initiating a SECURITY MODE COMMAND (i.e. after receiving the
ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, but before
sending a response to that message) and the ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received without integrity protection or
does not successfully pass the integrity check at the MME, the MME shall
calculate the HASH_(MME) of the entire plain ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as described in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19] and
shall include the HASH_(MME) in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.

Additionally, the MME may request the UE to include its IMEISV in the
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

NOTE 2: The AS and NAS security capabilities will be the same, i.e. if
the UE supports one algorithm for NAS, the same algorithm is also
supported for AS.

If:

- the NAS security mode control procedure is initiated during an ongoing
attach procedure in WB-S1 mode;

- the network supports RACS;

- the UE has set the RACS bit to "RACS supported" in the UE network
capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message; and

- the UE has set the URCIDA bit to "UE radio capability ID available" in
the UE radio capability ID availability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST
message,

then the MME shall request the UE to include its UE radio capability ID
in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

If:

- the NAS security mode control procedure is initiated during an ongoing
tracking area updating procedure in WB-S1 mode;

- the network supports RACS;

- the UE has set the RACS bit to "RACS supported" in the UE network
capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message; and

- the UE has set the URCIDA bit to "UE radio capability ID available" in
the UE radio capability ID availability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message,

then the MME may request the UE to include its UE radio capability ID in
the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

If:

- the NAS security mode control procedure is initiated during an ongoing
tracking area updating procedure in WB-S1 mode;

- the network supports RACS;

- the UE has set the RACS bit to "RACS supported" in the UE network
capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message;

- the UE has set the URCIDA bit to "UE radio capability ID available" in
the UE radio capability ID availability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message; and

- no UE radio capability ID is available in the UE context in the MME,

then the MME shall request the UE to include its UE radio capability ID
in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

[]

Figure 5.4.3.2.1: Security mode control procedure

5.4.3.3 NAS security mode command accepted by the UE

Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the UE shall check
whether the security mode command can be accepted or not. This is done
by performing the integrity check of the message and by checking that
the received replayed UE security capabilities, the received replayed UE
additional security capabilities, if included in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message, and the received nonce_(UE) have not been altered
compared to the latest values that the UE sent to the network. However,
the UE is not required to perform the checking of the received
nonce_(UE) if the UE does not want to re-generate the K'_(ASME) (i.e.
the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is to derive and take into use a
mapped EPS security context and the eKSI matches the current EPS
security context, if it is a mapped EPS security context). When the UE
has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established or the UE
is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services or the UE
is requesting attach for access to RLOS, the UE is not required to
locally re-generate the K_(ASME) (i.e. the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
is used to derive and take into use a native EPS security context where
the KSI value "000" is included in the NAS key set identifier IE and the
EIA0 and EEA0 are included as the selected NAS security algorithms).

The UE shall accept a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicating the "null
integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 as the selected NAS integrity
algorithm only if the message is received for a UE that has a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services established, or a UE that is
attached for access to RLOS, or a UE that is establishing a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services or a UE that is requesting
attach for access to RLOS.

If the type of security context flag included in the SECURITY MODE
COMMAND message is set to "native security context" and if the KSI
matches a valid non-current native EPS security context held in the UE
while the UE has a mapped EPS security context as the current EPS
security context, the UE shall take the non-current native EPS security
context into use which then becomes the current native EPS security
context and delete the mapped EPS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall take
the EPS security context indicated in the message into use. The UE shall
in addition reset the uplink NAS COUNT counter if:

- the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message is received in order to take an EPS
security context into use created after a successful execution of the
EPS authentication procedure;

- the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message received includes the type of
security context flag set to "mapped security context" in the NAS key
set identifier IE the eKSI does not match the current EPS security
context, if it is a mapped EPS security context.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted and a new EPS
security context is taken into use and SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
does not indicate the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 as the
selected NAS integrity algorithm, the UE shall:

- if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message has been successfully integrity
checked using an estimated downlink NAS COUNT equal 0, then the UE shall
set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new EPS security context to 0;

- otherwise the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT of this new EPS
security context to the downlink NAS COUNT that has been used for the
successful integrity checking of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message.

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the UE shall send
a SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message integrity protected with the selected
NAS integrity algorithm and the EPS NAS integrity key based on the
K_(ASME) or mapped K'_(ASME) if the type of security context flag is set
to "mapped security context" indicated by the eKSI. When the SECURITY
MODE COMMAND message includes the type of security context flag set to
"mapped security context" in the NAS key set identifier IE, the
nonce_(MME) and the nonce_(UE), then the UE shall either:

- generate K'_(ASME) from both the nonce_(MME) and the nonce_(UE) as
indicated in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]; or

- check whether the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message indicates the eKSI of
the current EPS security context, if it is a mapped EPS security
context, in order not to re-generate the K'_(ASME).

Furthermore, if the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message can be accepted, the
UE shall cipher the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message with the selected NAS
ciphering algorithm and the EPS NAS ciphering key based on the K_(ASME)
or mapped K'_(ASME) indicated by the eKSI. The UE shall set the security
header type of the message to "integrity protected and ciphered with new
EPS security context".

From this time onward the UE shall cipher and integrity protect all NAS
signalling messages with the selected NAS ciphering and NAS integrity
algorithms.

If the MME indicated in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that the
IMEISV is requested, the UE shall include its IMEISV in the SECURITY
MODE COMPLETE message.

In WB-S1 mode, if the MME indicated in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message
that the UE radio capability ID is requested, the UE shall:

- if the UE has an applicable network-assigned UE radio capability ID
for the current UE radio configuration in the selected PLMN, include the
applicable network-assigned UE radio capability ID in the UE radio
capability ID IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message; and

- if the UE:

a) does not have an applicable network-assigned UE radio capability ID
for the current UE radio configuration in the selected PLMN; and

b) has an applicable manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID for
the current UE radio configuration,

include the applicable manufacturer-assigned UE radio capability ID in
the UE radio capability ID IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

If, during an ongoing attach or tracking area updating procedure, the
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message includes a HASH_(MME), the UE shall
compare HASH_(MME) with a hash value locally calculated as described in
3GPP TS 33.401 [19] from the entire plain ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message that the UE had sent to initiate the
procedure. If HASH_(MME) and the locally calculated hash value are
different, the UE shall include the complete ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message which the UE had previously sent in the
Replayed NAS message container IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.

5.4.3.4 NAS security mode control completion by the network

The MME shall, upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message, stop
timer T3460. From this time onward the MME shall integrity protect and
encipher all signalling messages with the selected NAS integrity and
ciphering algorithms.

If the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message contains a Replayed NAS container
message IE with an ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message, the MME shall complete the ongoing attach or tracking area
updating procedure by considering the ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message contained in the Replayed NAS message container
IE as the message that triggered the procedure.

5.4.3.5 NAS security mode command not accepted by the UE

If the security mode command cannot be accepted, the UE shall send a
SECURITY MODE REJECT message. The SECURITY MODE REJECT message contains
an EMM cause that typically indicates one of the following cause values:

#23: UE security capabilities mismatch;

#24: security mode rejected, unspecified.

Upon receipt of the SECURITY MODE REJECT message, the MME shall stop
timer T3460. The MME shall also abort the ongoing procedure that
triggered the initiation of the NAS security mode control procedure.

Both the UE and the MME shall apply the EPS security context in use
before the initiation of the security mode control procedure, if any, to
protect the SECURITY MODE REJECT message and any other subsequent
messages according to the rules in clauses 4.4.4 and 4.4.5.

5.4.3.6 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY
MODE REJECT message indication from lower layers (if the security mode
control procedure is triggered by a tracking area updating procedure or
an attach procedure)

The UE shall abort the security mode control procedure and re-initiate
the tracking area updating procedure if the security mode control
procedure is triggered by a tracking area updating procedure.

The UE shall abort the security mode control procedure and re-initiate
the attach procedure if the security mode control procedure is triggered
by an attach procedure.

b) Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY
MODE REJECT message indication with TAI change from lower layers (if the
security mode control procedure is triggered by a service request
procedure)

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the security mode control
procedure shall be aborted and a tracking area updating procedure shall
be initiated.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the security mode
control procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE implementation
how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the security mode
control procedure.

c) Transmission failure of SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message or SECURITY
MODE REJECT message indication without TAI change from lower layers (if
the security mode control procedure is triggered by a service request
procedure)

The security mode control procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the
UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the
security mode control procedure.

5.4.3.7 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Lower layer failure before the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE or SECURITY
MODE REJECT message is received

The network shall abort the security mode control procedure.

b) Expiry of timer T3460

The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3460, retransmit
the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and shall reset and start timer T3460.
This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of
timer T3460, the procedure shall be aborted.

NOTE: If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message was sent to create a mapped
EPS security context during inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1
mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, then the network does not generate new
values for the nonce_(MME) and the nonce_(UE), but includes the same
values in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message (see the clause 7.2.4.4 in
3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

c) Collision between security mode control procedure and attach, service
request, tracking area updating procedure or detach procedure not
indicating switch off

The network shall abort the security mode control procedure and proceed
with the UE initiated procedure.

d) Collision between security mode control procedure and other EMM
procedures than in item c

The network shall progress both procedures.

e) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

If the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message could not be delivered due to an
intra MME handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then
upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall
retransmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message. If a failure of the
handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling
connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the SECURITY MODE COMMAND
message.

5.4.4 Identification procedure

5.4.4.1 General

The identification procedure is used by the network to request a
particular UE to provide specific identification parameters, e.g. the
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) or the International
Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI). IMEI and IMSI definition and structure
are specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2].

For mobile device supporting both 3GPP access and cdma2000^(®) access a
single IMEI is used to identify the device as specified in
3GPP TS 22.278 [1C]. If the UE is a MUSIM UE, the UE uses a separate
IMEI for each USIM the UE operates.

5.4.4.2 Identification initiation by the network

The network initiates the identification procedure by sending an
IDENTITY REQUEST message to the UE and starting the timer T3470 (see
example in figure 5.4.4.2.1). The IDENTITY REQUEST message specifies the
requested identification parameters in the Identity type information
element.

[]

Figure 5.4.4.2.1: Identification procedure

5.4.4.3 Identification response by the UE

A UE shall be ready to respond to an IDENTITY REQUEST message at any
time whilst in EMM-CONNECTED mode.

Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message the UE shall send an
IDENTITY RESPONSE message to the network. The IDENTITY RESPONSE message
shall contain the identification parameters as requested by the network.

5.4.4.4 Identification completion by the network

Upon receipt of the IDENTITY RESPONSE the network shall stop the timer
T3470.

5.4.4.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Requested identity is not available

If the UE cannot encode the requested identity in the IDENTITY RESPONSE
message, e.g. because no valid USIM is available, then it shall encode
the identity type as "no identity".

b) Transmission failure of IDENTITY RESPONSE message indication from
lower layers (if the identification procedure is triggered by a tracking
area updating procedure or an attach procedure)

The UE shall abort the identification procedure and re-initiate the
tracking area updating procedure if the identification procedure is
triggered by a tracking area updating procedure.

The UE shall abort the identification procedure and re-initiate the
attach procedure if the identification procedure is triggered by an
attach procedure.

c) Transmission failure of IDENTITY RESPONSE message indication with TAI
change from lower layers (if the identification procedure is triggered
by a service request procedure)

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the identification procedure
shall be aborted and a tracking area updating procedure shall be
initiated.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the identification
procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE implementation how to
re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the identification
procedure.

d) Transmission failure of IDENTITY RESPONSE message indication without
TAI change from lower layers (if the identification procedure is
triggered by a service request procedure)

The identification procedure shall be aborted and it is up to the UE
implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the
identification procedure.

5.4.4.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Lower layer failure

Upon detection of a lower layer failure before the IDENTITY RESPONSE is
received, the network shall abort any ongoing EMM procedure.

b) Expiry of timer T3470

The identification procedure is supervised by the network by the timer
T3470. The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3470,
retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message and reset and restart the timer
T3470. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth
expiry of timer T3470, the network shall abort the identification
procedure and any ongoing EMM procedure.

c) Collision of an identification procedure with an attach procedure

If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing
identification procedure has been completed and no attach procedure is
pending on the network (i.e. no ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has still
to be sent as an answer to an ATTACH REQUEST message), the network shall
proceed with the attach procedure.

d) Collision of an identification procedure with an attach procedure
when the identification procedure has been caused by an attach procedure

If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing
identification procedure has been completed and an attach procedure is
pending (i.e. an ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has to be sent as an
answer to an earlier ATTACH REQUEST message), then:

- If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST
message differ from the ones received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST
message, the network shall proceed with the new attach procedure; or

- If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall not
treat any further this new ATTACH REQUEST.

e) Collision of an identification procedure with a UE initiated detach
procedure

Detach containing cause "switch off" within the Detach type IE:

If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing
identification procedure has been completed, the network shall abort the
identification procedure and shall progress the detach procedure.

Detach containing other causes than "switch off" within the Detach type
IE:

If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the ongoing
identification procedure has been completed, the network shall complete
the identification procedure and shall respond to the detach procedure
as described in clause 5.5.2.

f) Collision of an identification procedure with a tracking area
updating procedure

If the network receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message before
the ongoing identification procedure has been completed, the network
shall progress both procedures.

g) Collision of an identification procedure with a service request
procedure

If the network receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for CS
fallback or 1xCS fallback before the ongoing identification procedure
has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.

h) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

If the IDENTITY REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an intra
MME handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon
successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit
the IDENTITY REQUEST message. If a failure of the handover procedure is
reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the
MME shall retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message.

5.4.5 EMM information procedure

5.4.5.1 General

The purpose of sending the EMM INFORMATION message is to allow the
network to provide information to the UE. The message implementation is
optional in the network. The UE may use the received information if the
UE supports implementing this message.

The EMM information procedure may be invoked by the network at any time
during an established EMM context.

5.4.5.2 EMM information procedure initiation by the network

The EMM information procedure consists only of the EMM INFORMATION
message sent from the network to the UE (see example in
figure 5.4.5.2.1). During an established EMM context, the network may
send none, one, or more EMM INFORMATION messages to the UE. If more than
one EMM INFORMATION message is sent, the messages need not have the same
content.

[]

Figure 5.4.5.2.1: EMM information procedure

5.4.5.3 EMM information procedure in the UE

When the UE (supporting the EMM information message) receives an EMM
INFORMATION message, it shall accept the message and optionally use the
contents to update appropriate information stored within the UE.

If the UE does not support the EMM information message the UE shall
ignore the contents of the message and return an EMM STATUS message with
EMM cause #97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".

5.4.5.4 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

If the EMM INFORMATION message could not be delivered due to an intra
MME handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon
successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit
the EMM INFORMATION message. If a failure of the handover procedure is
reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the
MME shall retransmit the EMM INFORMATION message.

5.5 EMM specific procedures

5.5.1 Attach procedure

5.5.1.1 General

The attach procedure is used to attach to an EPC for packet services in
EPS.

The attach procedure is used for the following purposes:

- by a UE in PS mode of operation to attach for EPS services only;

- by a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation to attach for
both EPS and non-EPS services;

- by a UE supporting NB-S1 mode only in PS mode of operation to attach
for EPS services and "SMS only";

- to attach for emergency bearer services;

- an attach for access to RLOS; or

- the UE has initiated a GPRS attach procedure while in A/Gb mode or Iu
mode or an initial registration procedure while in N1 mode and moves to
E-UTRAN coverage.

The lower layers indicate to NAS that the network does not support
emergency bearer services for the UE in limited service state
(3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). This information is taken into account when
deciding whether to initiate attach for emergency bearer services in
WB-S1 mode.

If the MME does not support an attach for emergency bearer services, the
MME shall reject any request to attach with an attach type set to "EPS
emergency attach".

If the MUSIM UE initiates the attach procedure and sets the attach type
to "EPS emergency attach" in the ATTACH REQUEST message, the network
shall not indicate the support of:

- the NAS signalling connection release;

- the paging indication for voice services;

- the reject paging request;

- the paging restriction; or

- the paging timing collision control;

in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

The lower layers may indicate to NAS whether the network supports access
to RLOS (3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). This information is taken into account
when deciding whether to initiate attach for access to RLOS in WB-S1
mode.

With a successful attach procedure, a context is established for the UE
in the MME. Furthermore, if the UE requested PDN connectivity, a default
bearer is established between the UE and the PDN GW, thus enabling
always-on IP connectivity to the UE. In WB-S1 mode, the network may also
initiate the activation of dedicated bearers as part of the attach
procedure. In NB-S1 mode the network shall not initiate the activation
of dedicated bearers.

With a successful attach procedure in NB-S1 mode, a context is
established for the UE in the MME. If the attach request included
information to request PDN connectivity, a default bearer is also
established between the UE and the PDN.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME, a default bearer need not be requested by the UE during the attach
procedure. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by
the UE or the MME, then the UE shall request establishment of a default
bearer.

During the attach procedure with default bearer establishment, the UE
may also obtain the home agent IPv4 or IPv6 address or both.

In a shared network, the UE shall choose one of the PLMN identities as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. The UE shall construct the TAI of the
cell from this chosen PLMN identity and the TAC received for this PLMN
identity as part of the broadcast system information. The chosen PLMN
identity shall be indicated to the E-UTRAN (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).
Whenever an ATTACH REJECT message with the EMM cause #11 "PLMN not
allowed" is received by the UE, the chosen PLMN identity shall be stored
in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if the UE is configured to use timer
T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE
shall start timer T3245 and proceed as described in clause 5.3.7a.
Whenever an ATTACH REJECT message with the EMM cause #14 "EPS services
not allowed in this PLMN" is received by the UE, the chosen PLMN
identity shall be stored in the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" and
if the UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and proceed as
described in clause 5.3.7a. Whenever an ATTACH REJECT message is
received by the UE with the EMM cause #12 "tracking area not allowed",
#13 "roaming not allowed in this tracking area", or #15 "no suitable
cells in tracking area", the constructed TAI shall be stored in the
suitable list.

An attach attempt counter is used to limit the number of subsequently
rejected attach attempts. The attach attempt counter shall be
incremented as specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6. Depending on the value of
the attach attempt counter, specific actions shall be performed. The
attach attempt counter shall be reset when:

- the UE is powered on;

- a USIM is inserted;

- an attach or combined attach procedure is successfully completed;

NOTE: The attach procedure can be initiated in S1 or S101 mode as
described in clause 5.5.1.

- a GPRS attach or combined GPRS attach procedure is successfully
completed in A/Gb or Iu mode;

- a registration procedure for initial registration performed over 3GPP
access is successfully completed in N1 mode and the UE is operating in
single-registration mode;

- a combined attach procedure is completed for EPS services only with
cause #2, #16, #17, #18 or #22;

- an attach or combined attach procedure is rejected with cause #11,
#12, #13, #14, #15, #25 or #35:

- a network initiated detach procedure is completed with cause #11, #12,
#13, #14, #15 or #25; or

- a new PLMN is selected.

Additionally the attach attempt counter shall be reset when the UE is in
substate EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and:

- a new tracking area is entered;

- timer T3402 expires; or

- timer T3346 is started.

5.5.1.2 Attach procedure for EPS services

5.5.1.2.1 General

This procedure can be used by a UE to attach for:

- EPS services only; or

- EPS services and "SMS only" if the UE supports NB-S1 mode only.

When the UE initiates the attach procedure for normal service, the UE
shall indicate "EPS attach" in the EPS attach type IE.

When the UE initiates the attach procedure for emergency bearer
services, the UE shall indicate "EPS emergency attach" in the EPS attach
type IE. The attach procedure for emergency bearer services is not
applicable for NB-S1 mode (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

This procedure can also be used by a UE in limited service state to
attach for access to RLOS.

When the UE initiates the attach procedure for access to RLOS, the UE
shall indicate "EPS RLOS attach" in the EPS attach type IE. The attach
procedure for access to RLOS is not applicable for NB-S1 mode (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

5.5.1.2.2 Attach procedure initiation

In state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE initiates the attach procedure by
sending an ATTACH REQUEST message to the MME, starting timer T3410 and
entering state EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED (see example in
figure 5.5.1.2.2.1). If timer T3402 is currently running, the UE shall
stop timer T3402. If timer T3411 is currently running, the UE shall stop
timer T3411.

The UE shall include the IMSI in the EPS mobile identity IE in the
ATTACH REQUEST message if the selected PLMN is neither the registered
PLMN nor in the list of equivalent PLMNs and:

a) the UE is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]; or

b) the UE is in NB-S1 mode.

For all other cases, the UE shall handle the EPS mobile identity IE in
the ATTACH REQUEST message as follows:

set to "Native GUTI" and include the UE status IE with a 5GMM
registration status set to "UE is not in 5GMM-REGISTERED state".

NOTE 1:Since MM context transfer is not possible between MME and AMF in
a network that indicates "interworking without N26 interface supported",
it is up to the UE implementation as to how to keep the 5GMM and EMM
states in the UE in sync.

ii) if the UE does not hold a valid GUTI, the UE shall include the IMSI
in the EPS mobile identity IE; or

2) the UE has received the interworking without N26 interface indicator

Figure 5.5.1.2.2.1: Attach procedure and combined attach procedure

5.5.1.2.3 EMM common procedure initiation

The network may initiate EMM common procedures, e.g. the identification,
authentication and security mode control procedures during the attach
procedure, depending on the information received in the ATTACH REQUEST
message (e.g. IMSI, GUTI and KSI).

If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message containing the Old
GUTI type IE and the EPS mobile identity IE with type of identity
indicating "GUTI", and the network does not follow the use of the most
significant bit of the <MME group id> as specified in
3GPP TS 23.003 [2], clause 2.8.2.2.2, the network shall use the Old GUTI
type IE to determine whether the mobile identity included in the EPS
mobile identity IE is a native GUTI or a mapped GUTI.

During an attach for emergency bearer services or an attach for access
to RLOS, the MME may choose to skip the authentication procedure even if
no EPS security context is available and proceed directly to the
execution of the security mode control procedure as specified in
clause 5.4.3.

5.5.1.2.4 Attach accepted by the network

During an attach for emergency bearer services, if not restricted by
local regulations, the MME shall not check for mobility and access
restrictions, regional restrictions, subscription restrictions, or
perform CSG access control when processing the ATTACH REQUEST message.
The network shall not apply subscribed APN based congestion control
during an attach procedure for emergency bearer services.

During an attach for access to RLOS, the MME shall not check for access
restrictions, regional restrictions and subscription restrictions when
processing the ATTACH REQUEST message.

If the attach request is accepted by the network, the MME shall send an
ATTACH ACCEPT message to the UE and start timer T3450.

If the attach request included the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in
the ESM message container information element to request PDN
connectivity, the MME when accepting the attach request shall:

- send the ATTACH ACCEPT message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE
contained in the ESM message container information element and discard
the ESM message container information element included in the attach
request if:

- the UE indicated support of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in
the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message;

- the MME supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection and PDN
connection is restricted according to the user's subscription data;

- the attach type is not set to "EPS emergency attach" or "EPS RLOS
attach"; and

- the request type of the UE requested PDN connection is not set to
"handover of emergency bearer services", "emergency" or "RLOS";

- otherwise, send the ATTACH ACCEPT message together with an ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contained in the ESM message
container information element to activate the default bearer (see
clause 6.4.1). In WB-S1 mode, the network may also initiate the
activation of dedicated bearers towards the UE by invoking the dedicated
EPS bearer context activation procedure (see clause 6.4.2). In NB-S1
mode the network shall not initiate the activation of dedicated bearers.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME, and the UE included an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE in the ESM message
container information element of the ATTACH REQUEST message, the MME
shall send the ATTACH ACCEPT message together with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE
contained in the ESM message container information element.

If the attach request is accepted by the network, the MME shall delete
the stored UE radio capability information or the UE radio capability
ID, if any.

In NB-S1 mode, if the attach request is accepted by the network, the MME
shall set the EMC BS bit to zero in the EPS network feature support IE
included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message to indicate that support of
emergency bearer services in NB-S1 mode is not available.

If the UE has included the UE network capability IE or the MS network
capability IE or both in the ATTACH REQUEST message, the MME shall store
all octets received from the UE, up to the maximum length defined for
the respective information element.

NOTE 1: This information is forwarded to the new MME during inter-MME
handover or to the new SGSN during inter-system handover to A/Gb mode or
Iu mode.

NOTE 2: For further details concerning the handling of the MS network
capability and UE network capability in the MME see also
3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

If the UE specific DRX parameter was included in the DRX Parameter IE in
the ATTACH REQUEST message, the MME shall replace any stored UE specific
DRX parameter with the received parameter and use it for the downlink
transfer of signalling and user data in WB-S1 mode.

In NB-S1 mode, if the DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE was included in the
ATTACH REQUEST message, the MME shall provide to the UE the Negotiated
DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message. The MME
shall replace any stored UE specific DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode with
the negotiated DRX parameter and use it for the downlink transfer of
signalling and user data in NB-S1 mode.

NOTE 3: In NB-S1 mode, if a DRX parameter was included in the Negotiated
DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, then the UE
stores and uses the received DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode (see
3GPP TS 36.304 [21]). If the UE did not receive a DRX parameter in the
Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE, or if the Negotiated DRX
parameter in NB-S1 mode IE was not included in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message, then the UE uses the cell specific DRX value in NB-S1 mode (see
3GPP TS 36.304 [21]).

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update
type IE, supports NB-S1 mode only and the MME decides to accept the
attach request for EPS services and "SMS only", the MME shall indicate
"SMS only" in the Additional update result IE and shall set the EPS
attach result IE to "EPS only" in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

The MME shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message only if the extended DRX parameters IE was included in
the ATTACH REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of
eDRX.

If

- the UE supports WUS assistance; and

- the MME supports and accepts the use of WUS assistance,

then the MME shall determine the negotiated UE paging probability
information for the UE, store it in the EMM context of the UE, and if
the UE is not attaching for emergency bearer services, the MME shall
include it in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message. The MME may take into account the UE paging probability
information received in the Requested WUS assistance information IE when
determining the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE.

NOTE 4: Besides the UE paging probability information requested by the
UE, the MME can take local configuration or previous statistical
information for the UE into account when determining the negotiated UE
paging probability information for the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

The MME shall assign and include the TAI list the UE is registered to in
the ATTACH ACCEPT message. The MME shall not assign a TAI list
containing both tracking areas in NB-S1 mode and tracking areas in WB-S1
mode. The UE, upon receiving an ATTACH ACCEPT message, shall delete its
old TAI list and store the received TAI list.

NOTE 5: When assigning the TAI list, the MME can take into account the
eNodeB's capability of support of CIoT EPS optimization.

The MME may include T3412 extended value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message
only if the UE indicates support of the extended periodic timer T3412 in
the MS network feature support IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message.

The MME shall include the T3324 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message
only if the T3324 value IE was included in the ATTACH REQUEST message,
and the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM.

If the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the UE included the
T3412 extended value IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message, then the MME
shall take into account the T3412 value requested when providing the
T3412 value IE and the T3412 extended value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message.

NOTE 6: Besides the value requested by the UE, the MME can take local
configuration or subscription data provided by the HSS into account when
selecting a value for T3412 (3GPP TS 23.401 [10] clause 4.3.17.3).

If the UE indicates support for EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in
the ATTACH REQUEST message and the MME supports EMM-REGISTERED without
PDN connection, the MME shall indicate support for EMM-REGISTERED
without PDN connection in the EPS network feature support IE of the
ATTACH ACCEPT message. The UE and the MME shall use the information
whether the peer entity supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection
as specified in the present clause 5 and in clause 6.

If the UE requests "control plane CIoT EPS optimization" in the
Additional update type IE, indicates support of control plane CIoT EPS
optimization in the UE network capability IE and the MME decides to
accept the requested CIoT EPS optimization and the attach request, the
MME shall indicate "control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported" in
the EPS network feature support IE.

If the UE indicates support for enhanced discontinuous coverage in the
ATTACH REQUEST message, and the MME supports enhanced discontinuous
coverage, the MME shall indicate "Enhanced discontinuous coverage
supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT
message.

If the MME supports NB-S1 mode, non-IP or Ethernet PDN type,
inter-system change with 5GS, UAS services or the network wants to
enforce the use of DNS over (D)TLS (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [24]), then the
MME shall support the Extended protocol configuration options IE.

NOTE 7: Support of DNS over (D)TLS is based on the informative
requirements as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19] and it is implemented
based on the operator requirement.

If the MME supports the Extended protocol configuration options IE and
the UE indicated support of the Extended protocol configuration options
IE, then the MME shall set the ePCO bit to "extended protocol
configuration options supported" in the EPS network feature support IE
of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage
in the ATTACH REQUEST message, and the network decides to restrict the
use of enhanced coverage for the UE, then the MME shall set the
RestrictEC bit to "Use of enhanced coverage is restricted" in the EPS
network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off
timer, and the MME decides to activate the congestion control for
transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall include
the T3448 value IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for dual connectivity with NR in the ATTACH
REQUEST message, and the MME decides to restrict the use of dual
connectivity with NR for the UE, then the MME shall set the RestrictDCNR
bit to "Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted" in the EPS
network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for N1 mode in the ATTACH REQUEST message
and the MME supports inter-system interworking with 5GS, the MME may set
the IWK N26 bit to either:

- "interworking without N26 interface not supported" if the MME supports
N26 interface; or

- "interworking without N26 interface supported" if the MME does not
support N26 interface

in the EPS network feature support IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE requests ciphering keys for ciphered broadcast assistance data
in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the MME has valid ciphering key data
applicable to the UE's subscription, then the MME shall include the
ciphering key data in the Ciphering key data IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT
message.

If the UE indicates support of the NAS signalling connection release in
the ATTACH REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the NAS
signalling connection release, then the MME shall set the NAS signalling
connection release bit to "NAS signalling connection release supported"
in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support of the paging indication for voice services
in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the
paging indication for voice services, then the MME shall set the paging
indication for voice services bit to "paging indication for voice
services supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH
ACCEPT message. Upon receipt of ATTACH ACCEPT message with the paging
indication for voice services bit set to "paging indication for voice
services supported", the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers that
paging indication for voice services is supported. Otherwise, the UE NAS
layer informs the lower layers that paging indication for voice services
is not supported.

If the UE indicates support of the reject paging request in the ATTACH
REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the reject paging
request, then the MME shall set the reject paging request bit to "reject
paging request supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the
ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support of the paging restriction in the ATTACH
REQUEST message, and the MME sets:

- the reject paging request bit to "reject paging request supported";

- the NAS signalling connection release bit to "NAS signalling
connection release supported"; or

- both of them;

in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message, and
the network decides to accept the paging restriction, then the MME shall
set the paging restriction bit to "paging restriction supported" in the
EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support of the paging timing collision control in
the ATTACH REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the paging
timing collision control, then the MME shall set the paging timing
collision control bit to "paging timing collision control supported" in
the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the MUSIM UE has included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the ATTACH
REQUEST message and if the MME supports paging timing collision control,
the MME shall include the Negotiated IMSI offset IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message, and the MME shall set the IMSI offset value to:

- A value that is different than what the UE has provided, if the MME
has a different value; or

- A value that is same as what the UE has provided, if the MME does not
have a different value;

and the MME shall calculate an alternative IMSI value using the IMSI
offset value and store it in the UE context as specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. The alternative IMSI value is used for deriving the
paging occasion as specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

If the MUSIM UE has not included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the
ATTACH REQUEST message, the MME shall erase any stored alternative IMSI
value for that UE, if available.

The MME shall set the redir-policy bit to "Unsecured redirection to
GERAN or UTRAN not allowed" in the Network policy IE of the ATTACH
ACCEPT message if unsecured redirection to a GERAN or UTRAN cell is not
allowed in the current PLMN. Otherwise, the redir-policy bit shall be
set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN or UTRAN allowed".

The MME may include the T3447 value IE set to the service gap time value
in the ATTACH ACCEPT message if:

- the UE has indicated support for service gap control; and

- a service gap time value is available in the EMM context.

If the network supports signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer
contexts and the UE indicated support of signalling for a maximum number
of 15 EPS bearer contexts in the ATTACH REQUEST message, then the MME
shall set the 15 bearers bit to "Signalling for a maximum number of 15
EPS bearer contexts supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of
the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

Upon receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop timer T3410.

The GUTI reallocation may be part of the attach procedure. When the
ATTACH REQUEST message includes the IMSI or IMEI, or the MME considers
the GUTI provided by the UE is invalid, or the GUTI provided by the UE
was assigned by another MME, the MME shall allocate a new GUTI to the
UE. The MME shall include in the ATTACH ACCEPT message the new assigned
GUTI together with the assigned TAI list. In this case the MME shall
enter state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in clause 5.4.1.

For a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain
different PLMN identities. The MME indicates the selected core network
operator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [8B]).

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains a GUTI, the UE shall use this GUTI
as the new temporary identity. The UE shall delete its old GUTI and
store the new assigned GUTI. If no GUTI has been included by the MME in
the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the old GUTI, if any available, shall be
kept.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported in the UE, the UE shall set its TIN
to "GUTI" when receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3412 extended value IE, then
the UE shall use the value in T3412 extended value IE as periodic
tracking area update timer (T3412). If the ATTACH ACCEPT message does
not contain T3412 extended value IE, then the UE shall use the value in
T3412 value IE as periodic tracking area update timer (T3412).

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE, then the UE
shall use the included timer value for T3324 as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13], clause 4.7.2.8.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then the UE shall
store the included DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code of the
registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the ME as
specified in annex C.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains Negotiated IMSI offset IE, the
MUSIM UE shall forward the IMSI offset value to lower layers. If the
ATTACH ACCEPT message does not contain Negotiated IMSI offset IE, the
MUSIM UE shall indicate to lower layers to erase any IMSI offset value,
if available.

The MME may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code (MCC+MNC). The UE
shall store the list as provided by the network, and if the attach
procedure is neither for emergency bearer services nor for access to
RLOS, the UE shall remove from the list any PLMN code that is already in
the list of "forbidden PLMNs" or in the list of "forbidden PLMNs for
GPRS service". In addition, the UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN
code of the registered PLMN that sent the list. The UE shall replace the
stored list on each receipt of the ATTACH ACCEPT message. If the ATTACH
ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the
stored list.

If the MME received the list of TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as
described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], and determines that, by UE
subscription and operator's preferences, any but not all TAIs in the
received list of TAIs is forbidden for roaming or for regional provision
of service, the MME shall include the TAI(s) in:

a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "Forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" IE;

b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "Forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service" IE; or

c) both,

in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

If the attach procedure is neither for emergency bearer services nor for
access to RLOS, and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a
member of the list of "forbidden PLMNs" or the list of "forbidden PLMNs
for GPRS service", any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the
corresponding list(s).

The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such
as IMS voice over PS session, location services (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS),
emergency bearer services, or CIoT EPS optimizations, in the EPS network
feature support information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS
capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency
bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The
upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.221 [8A], clause 7.2a and clause 7.2b, when
selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating
an emergency call, the upper layers also take both the IMS voice over PS
session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator into
account for the access domain selection. In a UE with LCS capability,
location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) shall be provided to the
upper layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE's application,
those indicators are taken into account as specified in
3GPP TS 24.171 [13C].

If the RestrictDCNR bit is set to "Use of dual connectivity with NR is
restricted" in the EPS network feature support IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT
message, the UE shall provide the indication that dual connectivity with
NR is restricted to the upper layers.

The UE supporting N1 mode shall operate in the mode for inter-system
interworking with 5GS as follows:

- if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to
"interworking without N26 interface not supported", the UE shall operate
in single-registration mode;

- if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to
"interworking without N26 interface supported" and the UE supports
dual-registration mode, the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or

NOTE 9: The registration mode used by the UE is implementation
dependent.

- if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to
"interworking without N26 interface supported" and the UE only supports
single-registration mode, the UE shall operate in single-registration
mode.

The UE shall treat the interworking without N26 interface indicator as
valid in the entire PLMN and equivalent PLMNs. The interworking
procedures required for coordination between 5GMM and EMM without N26
interface are specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

If the redir-policy bit is set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN or
UTRAN not allowed" in the Network policy IE of the ATTACH ACCEPT
message, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to
GERAN or UTRAN for the current PLMN to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN
or UTRAN not allowed" and indicate to the lower layers that unsecured
redirection to a GERAN or UTRAN cell is not allowed. If the redir-policy
bit is set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN or UTRAN allowed" or if
the Network policy IE is not included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the
UE shall set the network policy for the current PLMN to "Unsecured
redirection to GERAN or UTRAN allowed" and indicate to the lower layers
that unsecured redirection to a GERAN or UTRAN cell is allowed. The UE
shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to GERAN or UTRAN
to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN or UTRAN not allowed" and indicate
this to the lower layers when any of the following events occurs:

- the UE initiates an EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure in
a PLMN different from the PLMN where the UE performed the last
successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure;

- the UE is switched on; or

- the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

If the UE has initiated the attach procedure due to manual CSG selection
and receives an ATTACH ACCEPT message; and the UE sent the ATTACH
REQUEST message in a CSG cell, the UE shall check if the CSG ID and
associated PLMN identity of the cell are contained in the Allowed CSG
list. If not, the UE shall add that CSG ID and associated PLMN identity
to the Allowed CSG list and the UE may add the HNB Name (if provided by
lower layers) to the Allowed CSG list if the HNB Name is present in
neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed CSG list.

When the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, and if the UE has
requested PDN connectivity the UE shall forward the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to the ESM sublayer. Upon receipt of an
indication from the ESM sublayer that the default EPS bearer context has
been activated, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together
with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message contained in
the ESM message container information element to the network.

Additionally, the UE shall reset the attach attempt counter, enter state
EMM-REGISTERED, and set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME, and the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with an ESM
DUMMY MESSAGE, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together
with an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE contained in the ESM message container
information element to the network.

If the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message from a PLMN for which a
PLMN-specific attempt counter or PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter is
maintained (see clause 5.3.7b), then the UE shall reset these counters.
If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS
services", then the UE shall reset this counter.

When the UE receives any ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
messages during the attach procedure, and if the UE has requested PDN
connectivity the UE shall forward the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message(s) to the ESM sublayer. The UE shall send a
response to the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message(s)
after successful completion of the attach procedure.

If the attach procedure was initiated in S101 mode, the lower layers are
informed about the successful completion of the procedure.

NOTE 10: For the UE supporting non-IP or Ethernet PDN type or UAS
services, if the UE receives the ATTACH ACCEPT message and the ePCO bit
in the EPS network feature support IE is not set to "extended protocol
configuration options supported", the UE can perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] with the current PLMN considered as the
lowest priority after the completion of the attach procedure.

Upon receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop timer
T3450, enter state EMM-REGISTERED and consider the GUTI sent in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message as valid.

If the T3448 value IE is present in the received ATTACH ACCEPT message,
the UE shall:

- stop timer T3448 if it is running; and

- start timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE.

If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the ATTACH ACCEPT message
and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or deactivated,
the UE shall consider this case as an abnormal case and proceed as if
the T3448 value IE is not present.

If the UE has indicated "service gap control supported" in the ATTACH
REQUEST message and:

- the ATTACH ACCEPT message contains the T3447 value IE, then the UE
shall store the new T3447 value, erase any previous stored T3447 value
if exists and use the new T3447 value with the T3447 timer next time it
is started; or

- the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not contain the T3447 value IE, then
the UE shall erase any previous stored T3447 value if exists and stop
the T3447 timer if running.

In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to "RACS supported" in the
UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message, the MME may
include a UE radio capability ID IE or a UE radio capability ID deletion
indication IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message.

In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to "RACS supported" in the
UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST message and the ATTACH
ACCEPT message includes:

- a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to
"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested", the UE
shall delete any network-assigned UE radio capability IDs associated
with the registered PLMN stored at the UE, then the UE shall, after the
completion of the ongoing attach procedure, initiate a tracking area
updating procedure as specified in clause 5.5.3 over the existing NAS
signalling connection; or

- a UE radio capability ID IE, the UE shall store the UE radio
capability ID as specified in annex C.

If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming" IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the UE
shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE which are belonging to the
serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s), if not already stored, into the list
of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" and ignore the TAI(s) which do
not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s).

If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message, the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE which
are belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s), if not already
stored, into the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service" and ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong to the
serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s).

If for discontinuous coverage, the UE receives the Unavailability
configuration IE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and the End of
unavailability report bit is set to "UE does not need to report end of
unavailability", the UE is not required to trigger tracking area update
procedure when the unavailability period duration has ended. If the UE
does not receive the Unavailability configuration IE or the End of
unavailability report bit is set to "UE needs to report end of
unavailability", the UE should trigger tracking area update procedure
when the unavailability period duration has ended.

5.5.1.2.4A Attach successful for EPS services and not accepted for SMS services

Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter,
the description for attach for EPS services as specified in
clause 5.5.1.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following
description for attach for SMS services applies.

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update
type IE and supports NB-S1 mode only, the MME decides to accept the
attach request for EPS services only and:

- the location update for non-EPS services is not accepted by the VLR as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A]; or

- the MME decides to not accept the attach request for "SMS only",

the MME shall set the EPS attach result IE to "EPS only", shall not
indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update result IE in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message and shall include an appropriate SMS services status
value.

The UE receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message takes one of the following
actions depending on the value included in the SMS services status IE:

"SMS services not available"

The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, shall reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The USIM
shall be considered as invalid for SMS services until switching off or
the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as
described in clause 5.3.7a.

"SMS services not available in this PLMN"

The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, shall reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

The UE may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that
the SMS services are not available.

The UE shall not attempt normal attach or tracking area updating
procedures indicating "SMS only" with current PLMN until switching off
the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. Additionally, the UE
may perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

"Network failure"

The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set
to 5.

If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer
T3411 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS
services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer
T3402 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS
services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

"Congestion"

The UE shall stop the timer T3410 if still running. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be set to 5. The UE shall start the timer
T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, and shall enter
state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal
tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the
combined tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS
only" is triggered.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The attach procedure
shall be considered as failed for SMS services. The behaviour of the UE
in those cases is specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6A.

5.5.1.2.5 Attach not accepted by the network

If the attach request cannot be accepted by the network, the MME shall
send an ATTACH REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate EMM
cause value.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or
the MME, the attach request included a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message,
the attach procedure fails due to:

- a default EPS bearer setup failure;

- an ESM procedure failure; or

- operator determined barring is applied on default EPS bearer context
activation during attach procedure,

the MME shall:

- combine the ATTACH REJECT message with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT
message contained in the ESM message container information element. In
this case the EMM cause value in the ATTACH REJECT message shall be set
to #19 "ESM failure"; or

- send the ATTACH REJECT message with the EMM cause set to #15 "No
suitable cells in tracking area", if the PDN connectivity reject is due
to ESM cause #29 subject to operator policies (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]
for further details). In this case, the network may additionally include
the Extended EMM cause IE with value "E-UTRAN not allowed".

If the attach request is rejected due to NAS level mobility management
congestion control, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22
"congestion" and assign a value for back-off timer T3346.

In NB-S1 mode, if the attach request is rejected due to operator
determined barring (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [16C]), the network shall set the
EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a value for back-off
timer T3346.

If the attach request is rejected due to service gap control as
specified in clause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is running, the network
shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and may assign a
back-off timer T3346 with the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.

If the attach request is rejected due to incompatibility between the
CIoT EPS optimizations supported by the UE and what the network supports
and the network sets the EMM cause value to #15 "no suitable cells in
tracking area", the network may additionally include the Extended EMM
cause IE with value "requested EPS optimization not supported".

NOTE 1: How the UE uses the Extended EMM cause IE with value "requested
EPS optimization not supported" is implementation specific. The UE still
behaves according to the EMM cause value #15.

Based on operator policy, if the attach request is rejected due to core
network redirection for CIoT optimizations, the network shall set the
EMM cause value to #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required".

NOTE 2: The network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability,
the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the 5GS CIoT
network behaviour supported by the 5GCN to determine the rejection with
the EMM cause value #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required".

In NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode via satellite E-UTRAN access, if the attach
request is from a UE via a satellite E-UTRA cell and the network using
the User Location Information provided by the eNodeB (see
3GPP TS 36.413 [23]), is able to determine that the UE is in a location
where the network is not allowed to operate, the network shall set the
EMM cause value in the ATTACH REJECT message to #78 "PLMN not allowed to
operate at the present UE location".

Upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message, if the message is integrity
protected or contains a reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the
UE shall stop timer T3410.

If the ATTACH REJECT message with EMM cause #25 or #78 was received
without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the message.

If the MME received multiple TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as
described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], and determines that, by UE
subscription and operator's preferences, all of the received TAIs are
forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service, the MME
shall include the TAI(s) in:

a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" IE;

b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service" IE; or

c) both,

in the ATTACH REJECT message.

Regardless of the EMM cause value received in the ATTACH REJECT message,

- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming" IE in the ATTACH REJECT message, the UE
shall store the TAI(s) which are belonging to the serving PLMN or
equivalent PLMN(s) included in the IE, if not already stored, into the
list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" and ignore the TAI(s)
which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s); and

- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE in the ATTACH
REJECT message, the UE shall store the TAI(s) which are belonging to the
serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s)included in the IE, if not already
stored, into the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service" and ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong to the
serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s)

Furthermore, the UE shall take the following actions depending on the
EMM cause value received in the ATTACH REJECT message.

#3 (Illegal UE);

#6 (Illegal ME); or

#8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall consider
the USIM as invalid for EPS services and non-EPS services until
switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer
T3245 expires as described in clause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the UE shall
delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and enter state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI. If the message has been successfully integrity
checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM
considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this
counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If the message has
been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a
counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then
the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum
value.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the MM parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key
sequence number, and the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status,
P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the normal attach
procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

For the EMM cause value #3 or #6, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM
parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
for the case when the initial registration procedure performed over 3GPP

#42 (Severe network failure);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall
delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, eKSI, and list
of equivalent PLMNs, and set the attach attempt counter to 5. The UE
shall start an implementation specific timer setting its value to 2
times the value of T as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. While this timer
is running, the UE shall not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that
provided this reject cause a candidate for PLMN selection. The UE then
enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN
selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
set the GMM state to GMM-DEREGISTERED, GPRS update status to GU2 NOT
UPDATED, and shall delete the P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS
ciphering key sequence number.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to
5U2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered
TAI, TAI list and ngKSI.

#78 (PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location).

This cause value received from a non-satellite E-UTRA cell is considered
as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in
clause 5.5.1.2.6.

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. Additionally, the UE
shall reset the registration attempt counter. The UE shall store the
PLMN identity and, if it is known, the current geographical location in
the list of "PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location",
start a corresponding timer instance (see clause 4.11.2), enter state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform a PLMN selection according to
3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status and
registration attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the
case when the initial registration procedure performed over 3GPP access
is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE
in those cases is specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6.

5.5.1.2.5A Attach for emergency bearer services not accepted by the network

If the attach request for emergency bearer services cannot be accepted
by the network, the MME shall send an ATTACH REJECT message to the UE
including EMM cause #5 "IMEI not accepted" or one of the EMM cause
values as described in clause 5.5.1.2.5.

NOTE 1: If EMM cause #11 is sent to a UE of a roaming subscriber
attaching for emergency bearer services and the UE is in automatic
network selection mode, it cannot obtain normal service provided by this
PLMN.

Upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message including EMM cause #5, the UE
shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI.

Upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message including one of the other EMM
cause values, the UE shall perform the actions as described in
clause 5.5.1.2.5 with the following addition: the UE shall inform the
upper layers of the failure of the procedure.

NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or
other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

If the attach request for emergency bearer services fails due to
abnormal case a) in clause 5.5.1.2.6, the UE shall perform the actions
as described in clause 5.5.1.2.6 and inform the upper layers of the
failure to access the network.

NOTE 3: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or
other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

If the attach request for emergency bearer services fails due to
abnormal cases b), c) or d) in clause 5.5.1.2.6, the UE shall perform
the actions as described in clause 5.5.1.2.6 with the following
addition: the UE shall inform the upper layers of the failure of the
procedure.

NOTE 4: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or
other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

In a shared network, upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message, the UE
shall perform the actions as described in clause 5.5.1.2.5, and shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

NOTE 5: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or
other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN .

b) attempt to perform a PLMN selection in the shared network and, if an
attach for emergency bearer services was not already attempted with the
selected PLMN and the ATTACH REQUEST message:

- did not include a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type
set to "handover of emergency bearer services", initiate an attach for
emergency bearer services to the selected PLMN; or

- did include a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set
to "handover of emergency bearer services" and:

i) the selected PLMN is an equivalent PLMN, initiate an attach for
emergency bearer services to the selected PLMN; and

ii) the selected PLMN is not an equivalent PLMN, perform a PLMN
selection and initiate an attach for emergency bearer services to the
selected PLMN if an attach for emergency bearer services was not already
attempted with the selected PLMN.

In a shared network, if the attach request for emergency bearer services
fails due to abnormal case a) in clause 5.5.1.2.6, the UE shall perform
the actions as described in clause 5.5.1.2.6 and shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure to access the network; or

NOTE 6: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or

i) the selected PLMN is an equivalent PLMN, initiate an attach for
emergency bearer services to the selected PLMN; and

ii) the selected PLMN is not an equivalent PLMN, perform a PLMN
selection and initiate an attach for emergency bearer services to the
selected PLMN if an attach for emergency bearer services was not already
attempted with the selected PLMN.

In a shared network, if the attach request for emergency bearer services
fails due to abnormal cases b), c) or d) in clause 5.5.1.2.6, the UE
shall perform the actions as described in clause 5.5.1.2.6, and shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

NOTE 7: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or
other implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN .

b) attempt to perform a PLMN selection in the shared network and, if an

5.5.1.2.5B Attach for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services not accepted by the network

If the network cannot accept an attach request with attach type not set
to "EPS emergency attach" and including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message with request type set to "emergency", the UE shall perform the
procedures as described in clause 5.5.1.2.5. If the attach request with
attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach" for initiating a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services fails due to receiving the
AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, the UE shall perform the procedures as
described in clause 5.4.2.5. Then if the UE is in the same selected PLMN
where the last attach request was attempted, the UE shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

NOTE 1: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

b) attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services including the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

If the network cannot accept an attach request with attach type not set
to "EPS emergency attach" and including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message with request type set to "handover of emergency bearer
services", the UE shall perform the procedures as described in
clause 5.5.1.2.5. Then if the UE is in the same selected PLMN or
equivalent PLMN where the last attach request was attempted, the UE
shall attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services including the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

If the attach request with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach"
for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services fails due
to abnormal case a) in clause 5.5.1.2.6, the UE shall perform the
actions as described in clause 5.5.1.2.6 and inform the upper layers of
the failure to access the network.

NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

If the attach request with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach"
and including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set
to "emergency" fails due to abnormal cases b), c) or d) as well as l)
when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, and la) when the "Extended
wait time CP data" is ignored in clause 5.5.1.2.6, the UE shall perform
the procedures as described in clause 5.5.1.2.6. Then if the UE is in
the same selected PLMN where the last attach request was attempted, the
UE shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

NOTE 3: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

b) attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services including the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

If the attach request with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach"
and including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type set
to "handover of emergency bearer services" fails due to abnormal cases
b), c), d) or o) in clause 5.5.1.2.6, the UE shall perform the
procedures as described in clause 5.5.1.2.6. Then if the UE is in the
same selected PLMN or equivalent PLMN where the last attach request was
attempted, the UE shall attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer services
including the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

5.5.1.2.5B1 Attach by a UE transferring an emergency PDU session using a standalone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message

If the network cannot accept attach request including a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message with request type set to "handover" and the UE also
intends to transfer an emergency PDU session, the UE shall attempt EPS
attach for emergency bearer services including a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message with request type set to "handover of emergency bearer
services" for the emergency PDU session.

If the attach request, including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with
request type set "handover", fails due to abnormal case a) in
clause 5.5.1.2.6 and the UE intends to transfer an emergency PDU
session, the UE shall attempt EPS attach including a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message with request type set to "handover of emergency bearer
services" for the emergency PDU session.

If the attach request including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with
request type set "handover" fails due to abnormal cases b), c), d) or o)
in clause 5.5.1.2.6, the UE intends to transfer an emergency PDU
session:

- if an EMM cause set to #19 "ESM failure" is received, the UE shall
attempt EPS attach; and

- otherwise, the UE shall attempt EPS attach for emergency bearer
services,

with the ATTACH REQUEST message including a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message with request type set to "handover of emergency bearer services"
for the emergency PDU session.

5.5.1.2.5C Attach for access to RLOS not accepted by the network

If the attach request for access to RLOS is received by the network and
the UE requesting attach is not in limited service state, the MME shall
reject the UE's attach request.

If the attach request for access to RLOS cannot be accepted by the
network, the MME shall send an ATTACH REJECT message to the UE including
EMM cause #35 "Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN" or
one of the EMM cause values as described in clause 5.5.1.2.5.

Upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message including EMM cause #35, the UE
shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform a PLMN
selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] to attempt EPS attach for
access to RLOS via another PLMN.

Upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message including one of the other EMM
cause values, the UE shall perform the actions as described in
clause 5.5.1.2.5. along with the following conditions:

a) if the action for the reject involves searching for a suitable cell
in E-UTRAN radio access technology, the UE shall proceed with the action
and shall attempt to attach for access to RLOS in the new tracking area,
if found; and

b) if the action for the reject involves attempting to select GERAN or
UTRAN radio access technology or disabling the E-UTRA capability, the UE
shall skip the action for as long as access to RLOS is still needed.

NOTE: How long the UE attempts to access RLOS is up to UE
implementation.

Then if the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last attach
procedure was attempted and rejected and if timer T3346 is not running,
perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] to attempt EPS
attach for access to RLOS via another PLMN.

If the attach request for access to RLOS fails due to abnormal cases b),
c) or d) in clause 5.5.1.2.6, the UE shall perform the procedures as
described in clause 5.5.1.2.6 with the exception that the UE shall skip
actions that involve attempting to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology and actions that involve disabling the E-UTRA capability, for
as long as access to RLOS is still needed.

5.5.1.2.6 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Access barred because of access class barring, EAB, ACDC or NAS
signalling connection establishment rejected by the network without
"Extended wait time" received from lower layers

In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the attach procedure shall not be started. The UE
stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The attach procedure is started as soon as
possible, i.e. when access for "originating signalling" is granted on
the current cell or when the UE moves to a cell where access for
"originating signalling" is granted.

In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the attach procedure shall not be started. The UE
stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific,
e.g. the attach procedure is started again after an implementation
dependent time.

In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), a request for an exceptional event is received
from the upper layers, then the attach procedure shall be started.

NOTE 1: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring
alleviation indication from the lower layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

If access is barred because of access class barring for "originating
signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), ACDC is applicable to the request
from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach
procedure shall be started.

If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), a request with a higher ACDC category is received
from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the attach
procedure shall be started.

If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to
ACDC (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), a request with a certain ACDC category
is received from the upper layers and the UE supports ACDC, then the
attach procedure shall be started.

aa) Lower layer failure to establish the RRC connection and:

- the UE is in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is
present);

- the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for
initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach
type not set to "EPS emergency attach";

- the UE supports being configured with CustomLLFailureRetry as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]); and

- CustomLLFailureRetry leaf is present as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]);

The UE shall increment the UE implementation specific attempt counter.
If the UE implementation specific attempt counter is less than the value
of MaxMinRetry consecutive attempts, the UE shall start T3411 with the
duration of MinRetryTimer. If the UE implementation specific attempt
counter is equal to the value of MaxMinRetry, the UE shall start T3402
with the duration of MaxRetryTimer and set the attach attempt counter to
5.

The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall proceed as
described below.

b) Lower layer failure not covered in case aa) or release of the NAS
signalling connection without "Extended wait time" and without "Extended
wait time CP data" received from lower layers before the ATTACH ACCEPT
or ATTACH REJECT message is received

The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall proceed as
described below.

c) T3410 timeout

The UE shall abort the attach procedure. The NAS signalling connection,
if any, shall be released locally.

NOTE 2: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE
deems that the network has failed the authentication check as specified
in clause 5.4.2.7.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

d) ATTACH REJECT, other EMM cause values than those treated in
clause 5.5.1.2.5, and cases of EMM cause values #22, #25, #31 and #78,
if considered as abnormal cases according to clause 5.5.1.2.5

Upon reception of the EMM cause #19 "ESM failure", if the UE is not
configured for NAS signalling low priority and the ESM cause value
received in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message is not #54 "PDN
connection does not exist", the UE may set the attach attempt counter to
5. Subsequently, if the UE needs to retransmit the ATTACH REQUEST
message to request PDN connectivity towards a different APN, the UE may
stop T3411 or T3402, if running, and send the ATTACH REQUEST message. If
the UE needs to attempt EPS attach to request transfer of a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services by including a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message with request type set to "handover of emergency bearer
services", the UE shall stop T3411 or T3402, if running, and send the
ATTACH REQUEST message.

NOTE 3: When receiving EMM cause #19 "ESM failure", coordination is
required between the EMM and ESM sublayers in the UE to determine
whether to set the attach attempt counter to 5.

If the attach request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for
initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach
type not set to "EPS emergency attach", upon reception of the EMM causes
#95, #96, #97, #99 and #111 the UE should set the attach attempt counter
to 5.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

e) Change of cell into a new tracking area

If a cell change into a new tracking area occurs before the attach
procedure is completed, the attach procedure shall be aborted and
re-initiated immediately. If a tracking area border is crossed when the
ATTACH ACCEPT message has been received but before an ATTACH COMPLETE
message is sent, the attach procedure shall be re-initiated. If a GUTI
was allocated during the attach procedure, this GUTI shall be used in
the attach procedure.

f) Mobile originated detach required

The attach procedure shall be aborted, and the UE initiated detach
procedure shall be performed.

g) Detach procedure collision

If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state
EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED and the detach type indicates "re-attach not
required" and no EMM cause IE, or "re-attach not required" and the EMM
cause value is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the detach procedure shall
be progressed and the attach procedure shall be aborted. If the UE
receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state
EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED and the detach type indicates "re-attach
required", the detach procedure shall be progressed and the UE shall
locally release the NAS signalling connection, before re-initiating the
attach procedure. Otherwise the attach procedure shall be progressed and
the DETACH REQUEST message shall be ignored.

h) Transmission failure of ATTACH REQUEST message indication from lower
layers

The UE shall restart the attach procedure immediately.

i) Transmission failure of ATTACH COMPLETE message indication from lower
layers

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the UE shall restart the
attach procedure.

If the current TAI is still in the TAI list, it is up to the UE
implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure. The EMM sublayer
notifies the ESM sublayer that the ESM message in the ESM message
container IE of the ATTACH COMPLETE has failed to be transmitted.

j) If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE
or the MME, and the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted by the UE due to failure
in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall initiate the detach procedure
by sending a DETACH REQUEST message to the network. Further UE behaviour
is implementation specific.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME, and the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
combined with the ATTACH ACCEPT is not accepted by the UE due to failure
in the UE ESM sublayer, then the UE shall either send an ATTACH COMPLETE
message together with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT
contained in the ESM message container information element to the
network or initiate the detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST
message. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific.

k) Indication from the lower layers that an S101 mode to S1 mode
handover has been cancelled (S101 mode only)

The UE shall abort the attach procedure and enter state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.

l) "Extended wait time" from the lower layers

If the ATTACH REQUEST message contained the low priority indicator set
to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", the UE shall
start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value and reset the
attach attempt counter.

If the ATTACH REQUEST message did not contain the low priority indicator
set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", the UE is
operating in NB-S1 mode and the UE is not a UE configured to use AC11 –
15 in selected PLMN, then the UE shall start timer T3346 with the
"Extended wait time" value and reset the attach attempt counter.

In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving
cell, change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and
apply the normal cell reselection process.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

la) "Extended wait time CP data" from the lower layers

If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode, the UE shall start the timer T3346
with the "Extended wait time CP data" value and reset the attach attempt
counter.

In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time CP data".

The UE shall abort the attach procedure, stay in the current serving
cell, change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH and
apply the normal cell reselection process.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

m) Timer T3346 is running

The UE shall not start the attach procedure unless:

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE needs to attach for emergency bearer services;

- the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user
data related to an exceptional event and

i) the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the
ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EF_(NASCONFIG) in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]); and

ii) timer T3346 was not started when NAS signalling connection was
established with RRC establishment cause set to "MO exception data"; or

- the UE needs to attach without the NAS signalling low priority
indication and if the timer T3346 was started due to rejection of a NAS
request message (e.g. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST or
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST) which contained the low priority indicator set
to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority".

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process.

NOTE 4: It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate an
attach procedure while timer T3346 is running independent on whether
timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case or a non successful
case.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

n) If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and
the MME, an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE is included in the ESM message container
information element of the ATTACH REQUEST message and the UE receives
the ATTACH ACCEPT message combined with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT
message, the UE shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message together with an
ESM DUMMY MESSAGE contained in the ESM message container information
element to the network. Further UE behaviour is implementation specific.

o) Timer T3447 is running

The UE shall not start the attach procedure unless:

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE attempts to attach for emergency bearer services; or

- the UE attempts to attach without PDN connection request.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The attach request procedure is started, if still
necessary, when timer T3447 expires.

For the cases aa, b, c, d, l, la and m:

- Timer T3410 shall be stopped if still running.

- For the cases aa, b, c, d, l when the "Extended wait time" is ignored,
and la when the "Extended wait time CP data" is ignored, if the attach
request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a
PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to
"EPS emergency attach", the attach attempt counter shall be incremented,
unless it was already set to 5.

- If the attach attempt counter is less than 5:

- for the cases l, la and m, the attach procedure is started, if still
necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped;

- for the cases aa, b, c, d, l when the "Extended wait time" is ignored,
and la when the "Extended wait time CP data" is ignore, if the attach
request is neither for emergency bearer services nor for initiating a
PDN connection for emergency bearer services with attach type not set to
"EPS emergency attach", timer T3411 is started and the state is changed
to EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH. When timer T3411 expires the
attach procedure shall be restarted, if still required by ESM sublayer.

- If the attach attempt counter is equal to 5:

- the UE shall delete any GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI,
list of equivalent PLMNs and KSI, shall set the update status to EU2 NOT
UPDATED, and shall start timer T3402 if he value of the timer as
indicated by the network is not zero. The state is changed to
EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH or optionally to
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]; and

- if A/Gb mode, Iu mode or N1 mode is supported by the UE:

- if A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in
addition handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status,
P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the abnormal case when a normal
attach procedure fails and the attach attempt counter is equal to 5;

- if the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status,
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the abnormal case when an initial registration
procedure performed over 3GPP access fails and the registration attempt
counter is equal to 5; and

- except for case aa the UE shall attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN or
NG-RAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate GMM or 5GMM
specific procedures. For case aa the UE may attempt to select GERAN,
UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate GMM
or 5GMM specific procedures. Additionally, if the UE selects GERAN or
UTRAN radio access technology, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability
as specified in clause 4.5. If No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled at
the UE (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and the UE
selects NG-RAN radio access technology, it shall not disable the E-UTRA
capability; otherwise, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as
specified in clause 4.5.

- if the value of T3402 as indicated by the network is zero, the UE
shall perform the actions defined for the expiry of the timer T3402.

NOTE 5: Whether the UE requests RRC to treat the active E-UTRA cell as
barred (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]) is left to the UE implementation.

5.5.1.2.6A Abnormal cases in the UE, SMS services not accepted

The UE shall proceed as follows:

1) if the attach was successful for EPS services only and the ATTACH
ACCEPT message contained a value included in the SMS services status IE
not treated in clause 5.5.1.2.4A, the UE shall proceed as follows:

a) The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set
to 5;

b) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer
T3411 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS
services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered;

c) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer
T3402 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS
services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered; and

2) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6 apply.

5.5.1.2.7 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Lower layer failure

If a lower layer failure occurs before the message ATTACH COMPLETE has
been received from the UE, the network shall locally abort the attach
procedure, enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED and shall not resend the message
ATTACH ACCEPT. If a new GUTI was assigned to the UE in the attach
procedure, the MME shall consider both the old and the new GUTI as valid
until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network or the
EMM context which has been marked as detached in the network is
released.

If the old GUTI was allocated by an MME other than the current MME, the
current MME does not need to retain the old GUTI. If the old GUTI is
used by the UE in a subsequent attach message, the network may use the
identification procedure to request the UE's IMSI.

b) Protocol error

If the ATTACH REQUEST message is received with a protocol error, the
network shall return an ATTACH REJECT message with one of the following
EMM cause values:

#96: invalid mandatory information;

#99: information element non-existent or not implemented;

#100: conditional IE error; or

#111: protocol error, unspecified.

c) T3450 time-out

On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the
ATTACH ACCEPT message and shall reset and restart timer T3450.

This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of
timer T3450, the attach procedure shall be aborted and the MME enters
state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If a new GUTI was allocated in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message, the network shall consider both the old and the new GUTI as
valid until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network or
the EMM context which has been marked as detached in the network is
released. If the old GUTI was allocated by an MME other than the current
MME, the current MME does not need to retain the old GUTI.

If the old GUTI is used by the UE in a subsequent attach message, the
network acts as specified for case a above.

d) ATTACH REQUEST received after the ATTACH ACCEPT message has been sent
and before the ATTACH COMPLETE message is received

- If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST
message differ from the ones received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST
message, the previously initiated attach procedure shall be aborted if
the ATTACH COMPLETE message has not been received and the new attach
procedure shall be progressed; or

- if the information elements do not differ, then the ATTACH ACCEPT
message shall be resent and the timer T3450 shall be restarted if an
ATTACH COMPLETE message is expected. In that case, the retransmission
counter related to T3450 is not incremented.

e) More than one ATTACH REQUEST received and no ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH
REJECT message has been sent

- If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST
message differs from the ones received within the previous ATTACH
REQUEST message, the previously initiated attach procedure shall be
aborted and the new attach procedure shall be executed;

- if the information elements do not differ, then the network shall
continue with the previous attach procedure and shall ignore the second
ATTACH REQUEST message.

f) ATTACH REQUEST received in state EMM-REGISTERED

If an ATTACH REQUEST message is received in state EMM-REGISTERED the
network may initiate the EMM common procedures; if it turned out that
the ATTACH REQUEST message was sent by a genuine UE that has already
been attached, the EMM context, EPS bearer contexts, if any, are deleted
and the new ATTACH REQUEST is progressed, otherwise if network considers
ATTACH REQUEST message was not sent by a genuine UE based on
authentication procedure the network shall maintain the EMM-context, if
any, unchanged.

NOTE 1: The network can determine that the UE is genuine by executing
the authentication procedure as described in clause 5.4.2.

g) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message received before ATTACH COMPLETE
message.

Timer T3450 shall be stopped. The allocated GUTI in the attach procedure
shall be considered as valid and the tracking area updating procedure
shall be rejected with the EMM cause #10 "implicitly detached" as
described in clause 5.5.3.2.5.

h) DETACH REQUEST message received before ATTACH COMPLETE message.

The network shall abort the attach procedure and shall progress the
detach procedure as described in clause 5.5.2.2.

i) If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and
the MME, the MME receives an ATTACH REQUEST message with an ESM message
included in the ESM message container information element, and the ESM
sublayer in the MME detects a message error according to clause 7, the
MME may decide to proceed with the attach procedure or to reject it.
When sending the ATTACH ACCEPT or ATTACH REJECT message to the UE, the
MME shall include the ESM message provide by the ESM layer in the ESM
message container information element.

j) UE security capabilities invalid or unacceptable

If the ATTACH REQUEST message is received with invalid or unacceptable
UE security capabilities (e.g. no EPS encryption algorithms (all bits
zero), no EPS integrity algorithms (all bits zero), mandatory EPS
encryption algorithms not supported or mandatory EPS integrity
algorithms not supported, etc.), the MME shall return an ATTACH REJECT
message.

NOTE 2: EMM cause value to be used in ATTACH REJECT message is up to the
network implementation.

5.5.1.3 Combined attach procedure for EPS services and non-EPS services (S1 mode only)

5.5.1.3.1 General

The combined attach procedure is used by a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS
mode 2 of operation to attach for both EPS and non-EPS services, or both
EPS services and "SMS only".

The combined attach procedure is also used by a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or
CS/PS mode 2 of operation to attach for EPS services if it is already
IMSI attached for non-EPS services.

When the UE initiates a combined attach procedure, the UE shall indicate
"combined EPS/IMSI attach" in the EPS attach type IE.

The combined attach procedure follows the attach procedure for EPS
described in clause 5.5.1.2 with exception of clause 5.5.1.2.4A and
clause 5.5.1.2.6A.

5.5.1.3.2 Combined attach procedure initiation

If the UE is in EMM state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE initiates the
combined attach procedure by sending an ATTACH REQUEST message to the
network, starting timer T3410 and entering state
EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED (see example in figure 5.5.1.2.2.1).

The UE shall include the TMSI status IE if no valid TMSI is available.
Furthermore, if the UE has stored a valid location area identification,
the UE shall include it in the Old location area identification IE in
the ATTACH REQUEST message.

If the UE has stored a valid TMSI, the UE shall include the TMSI based
NRI container IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message.

If the UE initiates a combined attach procedure for EPS services and
"SMS only", the UE shall indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update
type IE.

5.5.1.3.3 EMM common procedure initiation

The network may initiate EMM common procedures, e.g. the identification,
authentication and security mode control procedures, depending on the
received information such as IMSI, GUTI and KSI.

5.5.1.3.4 Combined attach accepted by the network

5.5.1.3.4.1 General

Depending on the value of the EPS attach result IE received in the
ATTACH ACCEPT message, the following different cases can be
distinguished:

1) The EPS attach result IE value indicates "combined EPS/IMSI attach":
attach for EPS and non-EPS services, or for EPS services and "SMS only"
have been successful.

2) The EPS attach result IE value indicates "EPS only": attach for EPS
services has been successful but attach for non-EPS services or "SMS
only" has failed.

5.5.1.3.4.2 Combined attach successful

The description for attach for EPS services as specified in
clause 5.5.1.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following
description for attach for non-EPS services or "SMS only" applies.

The TMSI reallocation may be part of the combined attach procedure. The
TMSI allocated is then included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, together
with the location area identification (LAI). In this case the MME shall
start timer T3450 as described in clause 5.4.1.4, and enter state
EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED. If the MME does not indicate "SMS only"
in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, subject to operator policies the MME
should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than one location
area.

For a shared network in CS domain, the MME indicates the selected PLMN
for CS domain in the LAI to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [9].

The UE, receiving an ATTACH ACCEPT message, stores the received location
area identification, stops timer T3410, resets the location update
attempt counter and sets the update status to U1 UPDATED. If the message
contains an IMSI, the UE is not allocated any TMSI, and shall delete any
TMSI accordingly. If the message contains a TMSI, the UE shall use this
TMSI as the new temporary identity. The UE shall delete its old TMSI and
shall store the new TMSI. If neither a TMSI nor an IMSI has been
included by the network in the ATTACH ACCEPT message, the old TMSI, if
any available, shall be kept.

If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for
non-GPRS services" events (see clause 5.3.7b), then the UE shall reset
this counter.

If the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE, or if
the UE requested a combined attach for EPS and non-EPS services, but the
network decides to accept the attach request for EPS services and "SMS
only", the network shall indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update
result IE. In addition, if the SMS services are provided via SMS in MME,
the network shall provide a non-broadcast LAI in the ATTACH ACCEPT
message. If a TMSI has to be allocated, then the network shall also
provide a TMSI value which cannot cause any ambiguity with assigned TMSI
values.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message includes the Additional update result IE
with value "SMS only", a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 and a UE operating
in CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice available" shall not attempt to use CS
fallback for mobile originating services.

As an implementation option, if the ATTACH ACCEPT message does not
include the Additional update result IE with value "SMS only" and the UE
is not configured for NAS signalling low priority then the UE may stop
timer T3246 if running.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message includes the Additional update result IE
with value "CS Fallback not preferred", this indicates to a UE operating
in CS/PS mode 2 and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice
available" that it is attached for EPS and non-EPS services and that it
can use CS fallback.

If the LAI contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT message is a member of the
list of "forbidden location areas for regional provision of service" or
the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming" then such entry shall
be deleted.

If the PLMN identity for the CS domain which is provided as part of the
LAI contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT message differs from the PLMN
identity provided as part of the GUTI, the MME shall include the PLMN
identity for the CS domain in the list of equivalent PLMNs in the ATTACH
ACCEPT message.

The UE, when having requested PDN connectivity as contained in the
ATTACH REQUEST message and on receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message
combined with the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
shall send an ATTACH COMPLETE message combined with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT
EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message to the network.

Upon transmission of the ATTACH COMPLETE message the UE shall enter
state EMM-REGISTERED and MM state MM-IDLE and set the EPS update status
to EU1 UPDATED.

If the ATTACH ACCEPT message includes the Additional update result IE
with value "SMS only" or "CS Fallback not preferred", a UE operating in
CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice not available" shall attempt to select
GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and disable the E-UTRA capability
(see clause 4.5).

Upon receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE message, the MME shall stop timer
T3450, enter state EMM-REGISTERED.

NOTE: Upon receiving an ATTACH COMPLETE message, the MME sends an
SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in
3GPP TS 29.118 [16A].

After the UE performs intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode, if:

- the network supports SRVCC for IMS emergency sessions (see
3GPP TS 23.216 [8]);

- the UE has an emergency PDN connection;

- the UE has set the SRVCC to GERAN/UTRAN capability bit in the MS
network capability IE to "SRVCC from UTRAN HSPA or E-UTRAN to
GERAN/UTRAN supported; and

- the MME has neither an IMEI nor an IMEISV for the UE;

then the MME shall initiate the identification procedure (see
clause 5.4.4) or the security mode control procedure (see clause 5.4.3)
with the UE.

5.5.1.3.4.3 Combined attach successful for EPS services only

Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter,
the description for attach for EPS services as specified in
clause 5.5.1.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following
description for attach for non-EPS services applies.

If, due to emergency services fallback (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [59],
clause 4.13.4), there is a request for emergency services pending and
the emergency bearer services indicator in the EPS network feature
support IE indicates "emergency bearer services in S1 mode not
supported", then the UE shall skip the requirements defined below in the
present clause for the receipt of an ATTACH ACCEPT message including an
EMM cause value, attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology, select a setup message as defined in clause 5.3.7, proceed
with appropriate MM specific procedures, and send the setup message.

The UE receiving the ATTACH ACCEPT message takes one of the following
actions depending on the EMM cause value:

#2 (IMSI unknown in HSS)

The UE shall stop T3410 if still running and shall reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter. The UE shall set the update status to U3
ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key
sequence number. The UE shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.
The new MM state is MM IDLE. The USIM shall be considered as invalid for
non-EPS services until the UE is switched off, the UICC containing the
USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described in
clause 5.3.7a. If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered
invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE
implementation-specific maximum value.

If, due to emergency services fallback (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [59]), there
is a request for CS fallback call pending (see clause 5.3.7), the UE
shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and
attempt emergency call setup.

A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not
available" shall disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

#16 (MSC temporarily not reachable); or

#17 (Network failure)

The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, and shall enter state MM
IDLE. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be incremented,
unless it was already set to 5.

If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM.
When timer T3411 expires the combined tracking area updating procedure
indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered.

If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in
CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice available" shall start timer
T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter
state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3402 expires
the combined tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA
updating with IMSI attach" is triggered;

- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not
available" shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology and proceed with appropriate MM or GMM specific procedures
and disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

#18 (CS domain not available)

The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, shall reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

The UE shall enter state MM IDLE and shall set the update status to U2
NOT UPDATED.

A UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" shall
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and disable the
E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

A UE in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of
operation with "IMS voice available" may provide a notification to the
user or the upper layers that the CS domain is not available.

The UE shall not attempt combined attach or combined tracking area
updating procedures with current PLMN until switching off the UE or the
UICC containing the USIM is removed.

#22 (Congestion)

The UE shall stop the timer T3410 if still running. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be set to 5. The UE shall start the timer
T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, shall enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM, and shall enter state MM IDLE.

Other EMM cause values and the case that no EMM cause IE was received
are considered as abnormal cases. The combined attach procedure shall be
considered as failed for non-EPS services. The behaviour of the UE in
those cases is specified in clause 5.5.1.3.6.

5.5.1.3.5 Combined attach not accepted by the network

If the attach request can neither be accepted by the network for EPS nor
for non-EPS services, the MME shall send an ATTACH REJECT message to the
UE including an appropriate EMM cause value. If EMM-REGISTERED without
PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the attach request
included a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, and the attach procedure
fails due to a default EPS bearer setup failure, an ESM procedure
failure or operator determined barring, the MME shall:

- combine the ATTACH REJECT message with a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT
message contained in the ESM message container information element. In
this case the EMM cause value in the ATTACH REJECT message shall be set
to #19, "ESM failure"; or

- send the ATTACH REJECT message with the EMM cause set to #15 "No
suitable cells in tracking area", if the PDN connectivity reject is due
to ESM cause #29 subject to operator policies (see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]
for further details). In this case, the network may additionally include
the Extended EMM cause IE with value "E-UTRAN not allowed".

If the attach request is rejected due to NAS level mobility management
congestion control, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22
"congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

If the attach request is rejected due to service gap control as
specified in clause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is running, the network
shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and may assign a
back-off timer T3346 with the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.

Based on operator policy, if the attach request is rejected due to core
network redirection for CIoT optimizations, the network shall set the
EMM cause value to #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required".

NOTE: The network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability, the
5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the 5GS CIoT network
behaviour supported by the 5GCN to determine the rejection with the EMM
cause value #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required".

Upon receiving the ATTACH REJECT message, if the message is integrity
protected or contains a reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the
UE shall stop timer T3410 and enter MM state MM IDLE.

If the ATTACH REJECT message with EMM cause #25 or #78 was received
without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the message.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the EMM cause value
received in the ATTACH REJECT message.

#3 (Illegal UE);

#6 (Illegal ME); or

#8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI.

The UE shall consider the USIM as invalid for EPS and non-EPS services
until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the
timer T3245 expires as described in clause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the UE
shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI. If the message has been successfully integrity
checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM
considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this
counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If the message has
been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a
counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then
the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum
value.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the MM parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key
sequence number, and the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status,
P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the combined attach
procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

For the EMM cause value #3 or #6, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM
parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
for the case when the initial registration procedure performed over 3GPP
access is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

For the EMM cause value #8, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to
5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, and
shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and
ngKSI.

#7 (EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall consider
the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described
in clause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the UE shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the message has been successfully integrity checked
by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered
invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE
implementation-specific maximum value.

A UE which is already IMSI attached for non-EPS services is still IMSI
attached for non-EPS services and shall set the update status to U2 NOT
UPDATED.

The UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology
and shall proceed with the appropriate MM specific procedure according
to the MM service state. The UE shall not reselect E-UTRAN radio access
technology until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is
removed.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI
signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the combined attach procedure is
rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status,
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the initial registration procedure
performed over 3GPP access is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same
value.

#11 (PLMN not allowed); or

#35 (Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI, and reset the attach
attempt counter. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and
enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

The UE shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if
the UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and proceed as
described in clause 5.3.7a. If the message has been successfully
integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a PLMN-specific
attempt counter for that PLMN, then the UE shall set this counter to the
UE implementation-specific maximum value.

The UE shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the MM parameters update status, TMSI, LAI, ciphering key
sequence number and location update attempt counter, and the GMM
parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI,
GPRS ciphering key sequence number and GPRS attach attempt counter as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the combined attach
procedure is rejected with the GMM cause value #11 and no RR connection
exists.

For the EMM cause value #11, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM
parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list, ngKSI and registration attempt counter as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the initial
registration procedure performed over 3GPP access is rejected with the
5GMM cause with the same value.

For the EMM cause value #35, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to
5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, and
shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and
ngKSI. Additionally, the UE shall reset the registration attempt
counter.

#12 (Tracking area not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall reset the
attach attempt counter and enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of "forbidden tracking

procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status,
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, ngKSI and registration
attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when
the initial registration procedure performed over 3GPP access is
rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

#13 (Roaming not allowed in this tracking area);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall delete the

Additionally the UE enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE or
optionally EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of "forbidden tracking
areas for roaming". If the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity
protected, the UE shall memorize the current TAI was stored in the list
of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" for non-integrity protected
NAS reject message.

If the UE is registered in N1 mode and operating in dual-registration
mode, the PLMN that the UE chooses to register in is specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] clause 4.8.3. Otherwise the UE shall perform a PLMN

attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when
the initial registration procedure performed over 3GPP access is
rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

#14 (EPS services not allowed in this PLMN);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. Additionally the UE
shall reset the attach attempt counter and enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

The UE shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service" list and if the UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start
timer T3245 and proceed as described in clause 5.3.7a. If the message
has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains
a PLMN-specific PS-attempt counter for that PLMN, then the UE shall set
this counter to the UE implementation-specific maximum value.

A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is
already IMSI attached for non-EPS services is still IMSI attached for
non-EPS services and shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation and supporting A/Gb or Iu
mode may select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and proceed with
the appropriate MM specific procedure according to the MM service state.
In this case, the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability (see
clause 4.5).

A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation and supporting A/Gb or Iu

A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation and supporting S1 mode only,
or operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall delete the list of
equivalent PLMNs and shall perform a PLMN selection according to
3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI
signature, RAI, GPRS ciphering key sequence number and GPRS attach
attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when

addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to
5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, and shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally, the UE shall reset the
registration attempt counter.

#15 (No suitable cells in tracking area);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. Additionally the UE
shall reset the attach attempt counter and enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of "forbidden tracking
areas for roaming". If the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity
protected, the UE shall memorize the current TAI was stored in the list
of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" for non-integrity protected
NAS reject message. Additionally, the UE shall proceed as follows:

- if the UE is in WB-S1 mode and the Extended EMM cause IE with value
"E-UTRAN not allowed" is included in the ATTACH REJECT message, the UE
supports "E-UTRA Disabling for EMM cause #15", and the "E-UTRA Disabling
Allowed for EMM cause #15" parameter as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17] is present and set to
enabled, then the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in
clause 4.5 and search for a suitable cell in another location area or
5GS tracking area;

- if the UE is in NB-S1 mode and the Extended EMM cause IE with value
"NB-IoT not allowed" is included in the ATTACH REJECT message, then the
UE may disable the NB-IoT capability as specified in clause 4.9 and
search for a suitable cell in E-UTRAN radio access technology;

- otherwise, the UE shall search for a suitable cell in another tracking
area or in another location area according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the MM parameters update status, TMSI, LAI, ciphering key
sequence number and location update attempt counter, and the GMM
parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI,
GPRS ciphering key sequence number and GPRS attach attempt counter as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the combined attach

the initial registration procedure performed over 3GPP access is
rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

#22 (Congestion);

If the T3346 value IE is present in the ATTACH REJECT message and the
value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall proceed as described below; otherwise it shall be considered as an
abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE for this case is specified in
clause 5.5.1.3.6.

The UE shall abort the attach procedure, reset the attach attempt
counter, set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH.

The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

If the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall start
timer T3346 with the value provided in the T3346 value IE.

If the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall
start timer T3346 with a random value from the default range specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The attach procedure is started if still needed
when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status and GPRS attach
attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when
the combined attach procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the
same value.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status and
registration attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the
case when the initial registration procedure performed over 3GPP access
is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

#25 (Not authorized for this CSG);

EMM cause #25 is only applicable when received from a CSG cell. EMM
cause #25 received from a non-CSG cell is considered as an abnormal case
and the behaviour of the UE is specified in clause 5.5.1.3.6.

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
store it according to clause 5.1.3.3). Additionally, the UE shall reset
the attach attempt counter and shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has
sent the ATTACH REQUEST message are contained in the Allowed CSG list,
the UE shall remove the entry corresponding to this CSG ID and
associated PLMN identity from the Allowed CSG list.

If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has
sent the ATTACH REQUEST message are contained in the Operator CSG list,
the UE shall apply the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]
clause 3.1A.

The UE shall search for a suitable cell according to
3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the MM parameters update status and location update attempt
counter, and GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status and GPRS
attach attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case
when the combined attach procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with
the same value.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED and set the 5GS update
status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and reset the registration attempt
counter.

#31 (Redirection to 5GCN required);

EMM cause #31 received by a UE that has not indicated support for CIoT
optimizations or not indicated support for N1 mode is considered as an
abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in
clause 5.5.1.3.6.

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. Additionally, the UE
shall reset the attach attempt counter.

The UE shall enable N1 mode capability for 3GPP access if it was
disabled and disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5) and enter
state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status,
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, ngKSI and registration
attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when
the initial registration procedure performed over 3GPP access is
rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same value.

#36 (IAB-node operation not authorized);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any
GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI, and reset the
attach attempt counter. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs
and enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

The UE shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if
the UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and proceed as
described in subclause 5.3.7a. If the message has been successfully
integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a PLMN-specific
attempt counter for that PLMN, then the UE shall set this counter to the
UE implementation-specific maximum value.

The UE shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status,
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the initial registration procedure
performed over 3GPP access is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the same
value.

#42 (Severe network failure);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall
delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, eKSI, and list
of equivalent PLMNs, and set the attach attempt counter to 5. The UE
shall start an implementation specific timer, setting its value to 2
times the value of T as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. While this timer
is running, the UE shall not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that
provided this reject cause as a candidate for PLMN selection. The UE
then enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a
PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
set the GMM state to GMM-DEREGISTERED, GPRS update status to GU2 NOT
UPDATED signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number TMSI and
ciphering key sequence number.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to
5U2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered
TAI, TAI list and ngKSI.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE
in those cases is specified in clause 5.5.1.3.6.

5.5.1.3.6 Abnormal cases in the UE

The UE shall proceed as follows:

1) if the UE requested the combined attach for EPS services and "SMS
only" and the ATTACH ACCEPT message indicates a combined attach
successful for EPS and non-EPS services, the UE shall behave as if the
combined attach was successful for EPS services and "SMS only";

NOTE 1: In this case the UE can ignore the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION
message or the Paging with CN domain indicator set to "CS", as specified
in clause 5.6.2.3.2.

2) if the combined attach was successful for EPS services only and the
ATTACH ACCEPT message contained an EMM cause value not treated in
clause 5.5.1.3.4.3 or the EMM cause IE is not included in the message,
the UE shall proceed as follows:

a) The UE shall stop timer T3410 if still running, and shall enter state
MM IDLE. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be
incremented, unless it was already set to 5;

b) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM.
When timer T3411 expires the combined tracking area updating procedure
indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered;

c) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in
CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice available" shall start timer
T3402 if the value of the timer as indicated by the network is not zero,
shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM.

- If the value of T3402 as indicated by the network is zero, the UE
shall perform the actions defined for the expiry of the timer T3402.

- When timer T3402 expires the combined tracking area updating procedure
indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered; and

- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not
available" shall attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access
technology and proceed with appropriate MM, GMM or 5GMM specific
procedures. If the UE selects GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology,
the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5). If No E-UTRA
Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the UE (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and the UE selects NG-RAN radio access technology,
it shall not disable the E-UTRA capability; otherwise, the UE may
disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in clause 4.5; and

NOTE 2: Whether the UE requests RRC to treat the active E-UTRA cell as
barred (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]) is left to the UE implementation.

d) If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call
pending, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then
proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise
the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the EMM procedure to the MM
sublayer; and

3) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6 apply
with the following modification.

If the attach attempt counter is incremented according to
clause 5.5.1.2.6 the next actions depend on the value of the attach
attempt counter:

- if the attach attempt counter is less than 5, the UE shall set the
update status to U2 NOT UPDATED but shall not delete any LAI, TMSI,
ciphering key sequence number and list of equivalent PLMNs; or

- if the attach attempt counter is equal to 5, then the UE shall delete
any LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence number and list of equivalent
PLMNs and set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

- The UE shall attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access
technology and proceed with appropriate MM, GMM or 5GMM specific
procedures. Additionally, if the UE selects GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in
clause 4.5. If No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the UE (see
3GPP TS 24.368 [50] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and the UE selects NG-RAN
radio access technology, it shall not disable the E-UTRA capability;
otherwise, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in
clause 4.5.

NOTE 3: Whether the UE requests RRC to treat the active E-UTRA cell as
barred (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]) is left to the UE implementation.

If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call
pending, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then
proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures; otherwise
the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the EMM procedure to the MM
sublayer.

5.5.1.3.7 Abnormal cases on the network side

The abnormal cases specified in clause 5.5.1.2.7 apply.

5.5.2 Detach procedure

5.5.2.1 General

The detach procedure is used:

- by the UE to detach for EPS services only;

- by the UE to disconnect from the last remaining PDN it is connected to
if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or
the MME;

- by the UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation to detach for
both EPS services and non-EPS services or for non-EPS services only via
a combined detach procedure;

- by the network to inform the UE that it is detached for EPS services
or non-EPS services or both;

- by the network to disconnect the UE from the last remaining PDN to
which it is connected if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not
supported by the UE or the MME; and

- by the network to inform the UE to re-attach to the network and
re-establish all PDN connections.

NOTE 1: After a successful completion of an inter-system change of the
UE from S1 mode to non-3GPP access, if the non-3GPP network provides PDN
connectivity to the same EPC and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection
is not supported by the UE or the MME, the MME performs a local detach
of the UE.

NOTE 2: If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE
and the MME, the detach procedure is not triggered when disconnecting
the UE from the last remaining PDN to which it is connected.

The detach procedure also applies to the UE which is IMSI attached for
"SMS only".

The detach procedure with appropriate detach type shall be invoked by
the UE if the UE is switched off, the USIM card is removed from the UE,
the UE wishes to detach for EPS services, the UE wishes to detach for
non-EPS services or as part of the eCall inactivity procedure defined in
clause 5.5.4.

If the detach procedure is triggered due to USIM removal, the UE shall
indicate "switch off" in the detach type IE.

When upper layers indicate that emergency bearer services are no longer
required, the UE if still attached for emergency bearer services, may
perform a detach followed by a re-attach to regain normal services, if
the UE is in or moves to a suitable cell.

If a detach is requested by the HSS for a UE that has bearers for
emergency services, the MME shall not send a DETACH REQUEST message to
the UE, and shall follow the procedures in clause 6.4.4.1 for a UE that
has bearers for emergency services.

If the detach procedure for EPS services is performed, the EPS bearer
context(s), if any, for this particular UE are deactivated locally
without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME.

If the UE supports A/Gb mode or Iu mode or both, the UE shall store the
TIN in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as described in annex C, for a
subsequent attach procedure.

The UE is allowed to initiate the detach procedure even if the timer
T3346 is running.

The network proceeds with the detach procedure even if NAS level
mobility management congestion control is active.

5.5.2.2 UE initiated detach procedure

5.5.2.2.1 UE initiated detach procedure initiation

The detach procedure is initiated by the UE by sending a DETACH REQUEST
message (see example in figure 5.5.2.2.1.1). The Detach type IE included
in the message indicates whether detach is due to a "switch off" or not.
The Detach type IE also indicates whether the detach is for EPS services
only, for non-EPS services only, or for both. If the UE has a mapped EPS
security context as the current EPS security context, the UE shall set
the type of security context flag to "mapped security context".
Otherwise, the UE shall set the type of security context flag to "native
security context".

If the UE has a valid GUTI, the UE shall populate the EPS mobile
identity IE with the valid GUTI. If the UE does not have a valid GUTI,
the UE shall populate the EPS mobile identity IE with its IMSI.

If the UE does not have a valid GUTI and it does not have a valid IMSI,
then the UE shall populate the EPS mobile identity IE with its IMEI.

NOTE: During the attach for emergency bearer services or attach for
access to RLOS when the UE (with no USIM or invalid USIM) is in
EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED STATE, the UE has neither a valid GUTI nor a
valid IMSI.

If the detach is not due to switch off and the UE is in the state
EMM-REGISTERED or EMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED, timer T3421 shall be started
in the UE after the DETACH REQUEST message has been sent. If the detach
type indicates that the detach is for non-EPS services only the UE shall
enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.IMSI-DETACH-INITIATED, otherwise the UE
shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED. If the detach type
indicates that the detach is for non-EPS services or both EPS and
non-EPS services, the UE shall enter the state MM IMSI DETACH PENDING.

If the UE to be switched off is not operating in NB-S1 mode and not
operating in WB-S1 mode in any enhanced coverage CE mode, the UE shall
try for a period of 5 seconds to send the DETACH REQUEST message. If the
UE to be switched off:

- is operating in NB-S1 mode, then the UE should try for at least a
period of 85 seconds to send the DETACH REQUEST; or

- is operating in WB-S1 mode in any enhanced coverage CE mode, then the
UE should try for at least a period of 14 seconds to send the DETACH
REQUEST.

During this period, the UE may be switched off as soon as the DETACH
REQUEST message has been sent.

After the last DETACH REQUEST message is sent, the UE shall proceed as
follows:

- if the current EPS security context is a native EPS security context,
then the UE shall store the current EPS security context as specified in
annex C and mark it as valid;

- else if the current EPS security context is a mapped EPS security
context and a non-current full native EPS security context exists, then
the UE shall store the non-current EPS security context as specified in
annex C and mark it as valid, and finally the UE shall delete any mapped
EPS security context or partial native EPS security context.

[]

Figure 5.5.2.2.1.1: UE initiated detach procedure

5.5.2.2.2 UE initiated detach procedure completion for EPS services only

When the DETACH REQUEST message is received by the network, the network
shall send a DETACH ACCEPT message to the UE, if the Detach type IE does
not indicate "switch off". Otherwise, the procedure is completed when
the network receives the DETACH REQUEST message.

The network and the UE shall deactivate the EPS bearer context(s), if
any, for this UE locally without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE
and the MME.

The UE is marked as inactive in the network for EPS services. The
network shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

The UE, when receiving the DETACH ACCEPT message, shall stop timer
T3421. Furthermore, if the UE is operating in PS mode of operation, or
is operating in CS/PS mode of operation and supports S1 mode only then:

- If the detach procedure was performed due to disabling of EPS
services, then the UE shall enter the EMM-NULL state.

- Otherwise, the UE shall enter the EMM-DEREGISTERED state.

The UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation, and
supporting A/Gb mode or Iu mode, shall further set the update status to
U2 NOT UPDATED, disable the E‑UTRA capability (see clause 4.5) and
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN access technology.

5.5.2.2.3 UE initiated combined detach procedure completion

When the DETACH REQUEST message is received by the network, a DETACH
ACCEPT message shall be sent to the UE, if the Detach type IE does not
indicate "switch off". Otherwise, the procedure is completed when the
network receives the DETACH REQUEST message.

Depending on the value of the Detach type IE the following applies:

- combined EPS/IMSI detach:

The network and the UE shall deactivate the EPS bearer context(s) for
this UE locally without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the
MME. The UE is marked as inactive in the network for EPS and for non-EPS
services. The states EMM-DEREGISTERED and MM-NULL are entered in both
the UE and the network.

- IMSI detach:

The UE is marked as inactive in the network for non-EPS services. The
states MM-NULL and EMM-REGISTERED are entered in both the UE and the
network.

The UE, when receiving the DETACH ACCEPT message, shall stop timer
T3421.

5.5.2.2.4 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Access barred because of access class barring, EAB or NAS signalling
connection establishment rejected by the network

In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the detach signalling procedure shall not be
started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal
cell reselection process. The detach signalling procedure is started as
soon as possible and if still necessary, i.e. when access for
"originating signalling" is granted on the current cell or when the UE
moves to a cell where access for "originating signalling" is granted.
The UE may perform a local detach either immediately or after an
implementation dependent time.

In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the detach signalling procedure shall not be
started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal
cell reselection process. Further UE behaviour is implementation
specific, e.g. the detach signalling procedure is started again after an
implementation dependent time.

NOTE 1: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring
alleviation indication from the lower layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

b) Lower layer failure or release of the NAS signalling connection
before reception of DETACH ACCEPT message

The detach procedure shall be aborted and the UE proceeds as follows:

- if the detach procedure was performed due to disabling of EPS
services, the UE shall enter the EMM-NULL state;

- if "EPS detach" was requested for reasons other than disabling of EPS
services, the UE shall enter the EMM-DEREGISTERED state;

- if "IMSI detach" was requested, the UE shall enter the
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state and the MM-NULL state; or

- if "combined EPS/IMSI detach" was requested, the UE shall enter the
EMM-DEREGISTERED state and the MM-NULL state.

c) T3421 timeout

On the first four expiries of the timer, the UE shall retransmit the
DETACH REQUEST message and shall reset and restart timer T3421. On the
fifth expiry of timer T3421, the detach procedure shall be aborted and
the UE proceeds as follows:

- if the detach procedure was performed due to disabling of EPS
services, the UE shall enter the EMM-NULL state;

- if "EPS detach" was requested for reasons other than disabling of EPS
services, the UE shall enter the EMM-DEREGISTERED state;

- if "IMSI detach" was requested, the UE shall enter the
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE state and the MM-NULL state; or

- if "combined EPS/IMSI detach" was requested, the UE shall enter the
EMM-DEREGISTERED state and the MM-NULL state.

d) Detach procedure collision

Detach containing cause "switch off" within the Detach type IE:

- If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the UE initiated
detach procedure has been completed, this message shall be ignored and
the UE initiated detach procedure shall continue.

Detach containing other causes than "switch off" within the Detach type
IE:

- If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the UE initiated
detach procedure has been completed, it shall treat the message as
specified in clause 5.5.2.3.2 with the following modifications:

- If the DETACH REQUEST message received by the UE contains detach type
"re-attach required", and the UE initiated detach procedure is with
detach type "EPS detach" or "combined EPS/IMSI detach", the UE need not
initiate the attach or combined attach procedure.

- If the DETACH REQUEST message received by the UE contains detach type
"IMSI detach", and the UE initiated detach procedure is with detach type
"IMSI detach", the UE need not re-attach to non-EPS services.

- If the DETACH REQUEST message received by the UE contains detach type
"IMSI detach", and the UE initiated detach procedure is with detach type
"EPS detach" or "combined EPS/IMSI detach", the UE shall progress both
procedures. The UE need not re-attach to non-EPS services.

e) Detach and EMM common procedure collision

Detach containing cause "switch off":

- If the UE receives a message used in an EMM common procedure before
the detach procedure has been completed, this message shall be ignored
and the detach procedure shall continue.

Detach containing other causes than "switch off" and containing detach
type "IMSI detach":

- If the UE receives a message used in an EMM common procedure before
the detach procedure has been completed, both the EMM common procedure
and the detach procedure shall continue.

Detach containing other causes than "switch off" and containing other
detach types than "IMSI detach":

- If the UE receives a GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND, an EMM STATUS or an
EMM INFORMATION message before the detach procedure is completed, this
message shall be ignored and the detach procedure shall continue.

- If the UE receives an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST, SECURITY MODE COMMAND or
IDENTITY REQUEST message before the detach procedure has been completed,
the UE shall respond to it as described in clause 5.4.2, 5.4.3 and 5.4.4
respectively and the detach procedure shall continue.

f) Change of cell into a new tracking area

If the UE detects the current TAI is not in the stored TAI list occurs
before the UE initiated detach procedure is completed, the UE proceeds
as follows:

1) If the detach procedure was initiated for reasons other than removal
of the USIM or the UE is to be switched off, the detach procedure shall
be aborted and re-initiated after successfully performing a tracking
area updating procedure; or

2) If the detach procedure was initiated due to removal of the USIM or
the UE is to be switched off, the UE shall abort the detach procedure,
perform a local detach and enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

g) Transmission failure of DETACH REQUEST message indication with TAI
change from lower layers

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the UE proceeds as follows:

1) If the detach procedure was initiated for reasons other than removal
of the USIM or the UE is to be switched off, the detach procedure shall
be aborted and re-initiated after successfully performing a tracking
area updating procedure; or

2) If the detach procedure was initiated due to removal of the USIM or
the UE is to be switched off, the UE shall abort the detach procedure,
perform a local detach and enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the UE shall restart
the detach procedure.

h) Transmission failure of DETACH REQUEST message indication without TAI
change from lower layers

The UE shall restart the detach procedure.

i) Detach and paging procedure collision

If the UE receives a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message before the UE
initiated combined detach procedure with detach type "IMSI detach" or
"combined EPS/IMSI detach" has been completed, then this message shall
be ignored and the UE initiated combined detach procedure shall
continue.

For the cases b, f and g:

- Timer T3421 shall be stopped if still running.

5.5.2.2.5 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Detach request received in a CSG cell for which the UE has no valid
CSG subscription

If the UE initiates a detach procedure in a CSG cell the CSG ID of which
is not valid for the UE, and the detach procedure is not due to "switch
off", the network shall proceed as follows:

- if the detach type is "IMSI detach" and the UE has a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services active, the MME shall send a DETACH ACCEPT
message and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers, if any, by
initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure;

- otherwise, the network shall initiate the detach procedure. The MME
shall send a DETACH REQUEST message including the EMM cause #25,"not
authorized for this CSG".

b) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

If the DETACH ACCEPT message could not be delivered due to an intra MME
handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon
successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit
the DETACH ACCEPT message. If a failure of the handover procedure is
reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the
MME shall retransmit the DETACH ACCEPT message.

5.5.2.3 Network initiated detach procedure

5.5.2.3.1 Network initiated detach procedure initiation

The network initiates the detach procedure by sending a DETACH REQUEST
message to the UE (see example in figure 5.5.2.3.1).

NOTE: If the MME performs a local detach, it will inform the UE with an
EMM messages (e.g. SERVICE REJECT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE reject) with
EMM cause #10 "implicitly detached" only when the UE initiates an EMM
procedure.

The network may include an EMM cause IE to specify the reason for the
detach request. The network shall start timer T3422. If the Detach type
IE indicates "re-attach required" or "re-attach not required" and the
EMM cause value is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", or if the MME performs
a local detach, the MME shall either store the current EPS security
context if it is a native EPS security context, or the MME shall delete
the current EPS security context if it is a mapped EPS security context.
If the detach type IE indicates "re-attach required" or "re-attach not
required" and the EMM cause value is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the
network shall deactivate the EPS bearer context(s), if any, for the UE
locally and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED.

In NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode via satellite E-UTRAN access, if the network
initiates the detach procedure because the network determines that the
UE is in a location where the network is not allowed to operate (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]), the network shall set the EMM cause value in the
DETACH REQUEST message to #78 "PLMN not allowed to operate at the
present UE location".

If the network detach is triggered because the MME determines that, by
UE subscription and operator's preferences, all of the TAIs received
from the satellite E-UTRAN are forbidden for roaming or for regional
provision of service, the MME shall include the TAI(s) in:

a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" IE;

b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service" IE; or

c) both,

in the DETACH REQUEST message.

Figure 5.5.2.3.1: Network initiated detach procedure

5.5.2.3.2 Network initiated detach procedure completion by the UE

When receiving the DETACH REQUEST message and the detach type indicates
"re-attach required", the UE shall deactivate the EPS bearer context(s),
if any, including the default EPS bearer context locally without
peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME. The UE shall stop
the timer T3346, if it is running. The UE shall also stop timer(s) T3396
and ESM back-off timer(s) not related to congestion control (see
clause 6.3.6), if running. If the UE is operating in single-registration
mode, the UE shall also stop 5GSM back-off timer(s) not related to
congestion control (see clause 6.2.12 in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]), if
running. The UE shall send a DETACH ACCEPT message to the network and
enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. Furthermore, the UE shall, after the
completion of the detach procedure, and the release of the existing NAS
signalling connection, initiate an attach or combined attach procedure.
The UE shall enable N1 mode capability for 3GPP access if it was
previously disabled (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) and the UE is configured
with the "Re_enable_N1_upon_reattach" leaf of the NAS configuration MO
which indicates the "re-enabling N1 mode capability when performing
re-attach" is enabled (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]). The UE should also
re-establish any previously established PDN connection(s).

NOTE 1: When the detach type indicates "re-attach required", user
interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate
the EPS bearer(s), if any, automatically.

A UE which receives a DETACH REQUEST message with detach type indicating
"re-attach required" or "re-attach not required" and no EMM cause IE, is
detached only for EPS services.

When receiving the DETACH REQUEST message and the detach type indicates
"IMSI detach", the UE shall not deactivate the EPS bearer context(s)
including the default EPS bearer context. The UE shall set the MM update
status to U2 NOT UPDATED. A UE may send a DETACH ACCEPT message to the
network, and shall re-attach to non-EPS services by performing the
combined tracking area updating procedure according to clause 5.5.3.3,
sending a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with EPS update type IE
indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach".

If the UE is attached for EPS and non-EPS services, then the UE shall
set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED if:

- the Detach type IE indicates "re-attach required"; or

- the Detach type IE indicates "re-attach not required" and no EMM cause
IE is included.

When receiving the DETACH REQUEST message and the detach type indicates
"re-attach not required" and no EMM cause IE, or "re-attach not
required" and the EMM cause value is not #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the
UE shall deactivate the EPS bearer context(s), if any, including the
default EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-peer signalling
between the UE and the MME. The UE shall then send a DETACH ACCEPT
message to the network and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

Regardless of the EMM cause value received in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST
message via satellite E-UTRAN,

- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming" IE in the DETACH REQUEST message, the UE
shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE which are belonging to the
serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s), if not already stored, into the list
of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" and ignore the TAI(s) which do
not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s); and

- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE in the DETACH
REQUEST message, the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE which
are belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s), if not already
stored, into the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service" and ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong to the
serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s).

If the detach type indicates "IMSI detach" or "re-attach required", then
the UE shall ignore the EMM cause IE if received.

If the detach type indicates "re-attach not required", the UE shall take
the following actions depending on the received EMM cause value:

#2 (IMSI unknown in HSS);

The UE shall handle the MM parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and
ciphering key sequence number as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for
the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with the GMM cause with the
same value and with detach type set to "re-attach not required". The
USIM shall be considered as invalid for non-EPS services until switching
off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245
expires as described in clause 5.3.7a. If the UE maintains a counter for
"SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE shall
set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

The UE is still attached for EPS services in the network.

#3 (Illegal UE);

#6 (Illegal ME); or

#8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI. The UE shall consider the
USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described
in clause 5.3.7a. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and
shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI. If the UE maintains a
counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE
shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If
the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS
services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE
implementation-specific maximum value.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
MM parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number
and the GMM parameters GMM state, RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, GPRS
ciphering key sequence number and GPRS update status as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with
the GMM cause with the same value and with detach type set to "re-attach
not required". The USIM shall also be considered as invalid for non-EPS
services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed
or the timer T3245 expires as described in clause 5.3.7a.

For the EMM cause value #3 or #6, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM
state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list
and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when a
DEREGISTRATION REQUEST is received over 3GPP access with the 5GMM cause
with the same value, with de-registration type set to "re-registration
not required" and with access type set to "3GPP access".

For the EMM cause value #8, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to
5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, and
shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and
ngKSI.

NOTE 2: The possibility to configure a UE so that the radio transceiver
for a specific radio access technology is not active, although it is
implemented in the UE, is out of scope of the present specification.

#7 (EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI. The UE shall consider the
USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described
in clause 5.3.7a. The UE shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the
UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS
services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE
implementation-specific maximum value.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
GMM parameters GMM state, RAI, P‑TMSI, P-TMSI signature, GPRS ciphering
key sequence number and GPRS update status as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with
the GMM cause with the same value and with detach type set to "re-attach
not required".

A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is
IMSI attached for non-EPS services is still IMSI attached for non-EPS
services in the network. The UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode
2 of operation shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED, shall
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN access technology and shall proceed
with the appropriate MM specific procedure according to the MM service
state. The UE shall not reselect E-UTRAN radio access technology until
switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle
the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
for the case when a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST is received over 3GPP access
with the 5GMM cause with the same value, with de-registration type set
to "re-registration not required" and with access type set to "3GPP
access".

#11 (PLMN not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI. The UE shall delete the
list of equivalent PLMNs, shall reset the attach attempt counter and
enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

The UE shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if
the UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and proceed as
described in clause 5.3.7a. If the message has been successfully
integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a PLMN-specific
attempt counter for that PLMN, then the UE shall set this counter to the
UE implementation-specific maximum value.

The UE shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
MM parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number
and the GMM parameters GMM state, RAI, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, GPRS
ciphering key sequence number, GPRS update status and GPRS attach
attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a
DETACH REQUEST is received with the GMM cause with the same value and
with detach type set to "re-attach not required".

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall handle
the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list, ngKSI and registration attempt counter as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when a DEREGISTRATION
REQUEST is received over 3GPP access with the 5GMM cause with the same
value, with de-registration type set to "re-registration not required"
and with access type set to "3GPP access".

#12 (Tracking area not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI. The UE shall reset the
attach attempt counter and shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

The UE shall store the current TAI in the list of "forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service".

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
GMM parameters GMM state, RAI, P‑TMSI, P-TMSI signature, GPRS ciphering
key sequence number, GPRS update status and GPRS attach attempt counter
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a DETACH REQUEST
is received with the GMM cause with the same value and with detach type
set to "re-attach not required". If the UE is IMSI attached for non-EPS
services, the UE shall in addition handle the MM parameters update
status, TMSI, LAI, ciphering key sequence number and location update
attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a
DETACH REQUEST is received with the GMM cause with the same value and

with the 5GMM cause with the same value, with de-registration type set
to "re-registration not required" and with access type set to "3GPP
access".

#13 (Roaming not allowed in this tracking area);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and KSI. The UE shall delete the
list of equivalent PLMNs, reset the attach attempt counter and shall
change to state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

attach attempt counter and shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

If the cell where the UE has received the DETACH REQUEST message is a
CSG cell and the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell are
contained in the Allowed CSG list, the UE shall remove the entry
corresponding to this CSG ID and associated PLMN identity from the
Allowed CSG list.

If the cell where the UE has received the DETACH REQUEST message is a
CSG cell and the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell are
contained in the Operator CSG list, the UE shall apply the procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] clause 3.1A.

The UE shall search for a suitable cell according to
3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status and GPRS attach attempt
counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a DETACH
REQUEST is received with GMM cause with the same value and with detach
type set to "re-attach not required". If the UE is IMSI attached for
non-EPS services, the UE shall in addition handle the MM parameters
update status and location update attempt counter as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a DETACH REQUEST is received with
the GMM cause with the same value and with detach type set to "re-attach
not required".

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED and set the 5GS update
status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and reset the registration attempt
counter.

#78 (PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location).

This cause value received from a non-satellite E-UTRA cell is considered
as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in
clause 5.5.2.3.4.

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. Additionally, the UE
shall reset the registration attempt counter. The UE shall store the
PLMN identity and, if it is known, the current geographical location in
the list of "PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location",
start a corresponding timer instance (see clause 4.11.2), enter state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform a PLMN selection according to
3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to
5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, and shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI. Additionally, the UE shall reset the
registration attempt counter.

#36 (IAB-node operation not authorized);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any
GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall
delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

The UE shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if
the UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and proceed as
described in subclause 5.3.7a. If the message has been successfully
integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a PLMN-specific
attempt counter for that PLMN, then the UE shall set this counter to the
UE implementation-specific maximum value.

The UE shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status,
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST over 3GPP
access is received with the 5GMM cause with the same value , with
de-registration type set to "re-registration not required" and with
access type set to "3GPP access".

Other EMM cause values or if no EMM cause IE is included is considered
as abnormal cases. The behaviour of the UE in those cases is described
in clause 5.5.2.3.4.

5.5.2.3.3 Network initiated detach procedure completion by the network

The network shall stop timer T3422 upon receipt of the DETACH ACCEPT
message. If the Detach type IE indicates "IMSI detach", or "re-attach
not required" and the EMM cause value is #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the
network shall not change the current EMM state; otherwise the network
shall enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

5.5.2.3.4 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Transmission failure of DETACH ACCEPT message indication from lower
layers

The detach procedure shall be progressed and the UE shall send the
DETACH ACCEPT message.

b) DETACH REQUEST, other EMM cause values than those treated in
clause 5.5.2.3.2 or no EMM cause IE is included, and the Detach type IE
indicates "re-attach not required"

The UE shall delete any GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI,
list of equivalent PLMNs, KSI, shall set the update status to EU2 NOT
UPDATED and shall start timer T3402.

A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation which is
IMSI attached for non-EPS services is still IMSI attached for non-EPS
services and shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

A UE not supporting any of A/Gb mode, Iu mode or N1 mode may enter the
state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]; otherwise the UE shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH.

A UE supporting A/Gb mode, Iu mode or N1 mode shall

- enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED and attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN,
or NR radio access technology and proceed with the appropriate MM, GMM
or 5GMM specific procedures. In this case, the UE may disable the E-UTRA
capability (see clause 4.5);

- enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a
PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]; or

- enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-ATTACH.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall set the
GPRS update status to GU2 NOT UPDATED and shall delete the GMM
parameters P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature, RAI, GPRS ciphering key sequence
number and shall enter the state GMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to
5U2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered
TAI, TAI list and ngKSI.

5.5.2.3.5 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) T3422 time-out

On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the
DETACH REQUEST message and shall start timer T3422. This retransmission
is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3422, the
detach procedure shall be aborted. If the detach type is "IMSI detach",
or "re-attach not required" and the EMM cause value is #2 "IMSI unknown
in HSS", the network shall not change the current EMM state; otherwise
the network shall change to state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

b) Lower layer failure

The detach procedure is aborted. If the detach type indicates "IMSI
detach", or "re-attach not required" and the EMM cause value is #2 "IMSI
unknown in HSS", the network shall not change the current EMM state;
otherwise the network shall change to state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

c) Detach procedure collision

If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message with "switch off"
indication, before the network initiated detach procedure has been
completed, both procedures shall be considered completed.

If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message without "switch off"
indication, before the network initiated detach procedure has been
completed, the network shall send a DETACH ACCEPT message to the UE.

d) Detach and attach procedure collision

If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the network
initiated detach procedure with detach type "re-attach not required"
with no EMM cause IE, or "re-attach not required" and the EMM cause
value not #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", has been completed, the network
shall ignore the ATTACH REQUEST message. If the Detach type IE, sent in
the DETACH REQUEST message, indicates "re-attach required" the detach
procedure is aborted and the attach procedure shall be progressed after
the EPS bearer context(s) have been deleted. If the Detach type IE, sent
in DETACH REQUEST message, indicates "IMSI detach", or "re-attach not
required" and the EMM cause value is #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the
detach procedure is aborted and the attach procedure shall be
progressed.

e) Detach and tracking area updating procedure collision

If the Detach type IE, sent in DETACH REQUEST message, indicates
"re-attach not required" with no EMM cause IE, or "re-attach not
required" with EMM cause other than #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or
indicates "re-attach required", and the network receives a TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message before the network initiated detach procedure has
been completed, the detach procedure shall be progressed, i.e. the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall be ignored.

If the Detach type IE, sent in DETACH REQUEST message, indicates
"re-attach not required" with EMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or
indicates "IMSI detach" and the network receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message before the network initiated detach procedure has been
completed, the network shall abort the detach procedure, shall stop
T3422 and shall progress the tracking area updating procedure.

f) Detach and service request procedure collision

If the network receives a SERVICE REQUEST message or an EXTENDED SERVICE
REQUEST message for packet services before the network initiated detach
procedure has been completed (e.g. the DETACH REQUEST message is pending
to be sent to the UE) and the DETACH REQUEST contains detach type
"re-attach not required" with EMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or
detach type "IMSI detach", the network shall progress both procedures.
If the DETACH REQUEST message contains detach type "re-attach not
required" with no EMM cause IE, or "re-attach not required" with EMM
cause other than #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or detach type "re-attach
required", the network shall progress the detach procedure.

If the network receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for CS
fallback, but not for CS fallback for emergency call, before the network
initiated detach procedure has been completed (e.g. the DETACH REQUEST
message is pending to be sent to the UE) and the DETACH REQUEST contains
detach type "re-attach not required" with EMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in
HSS" or detach type "IMSI detach", the network shall ignore the EXTENDED
SERVICE REQUEST message and progress the detach procedure.

If the network receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for CS
fallback for emergency call before the network initiated detach
procedure has been completed (e.g. the DETACH REQUEST message is pending
to be sent to the UE) and the DETACH REQUEST contains detach type
"re-attach not required" with EMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS" or
detach type "IMSI detach", the network shall progress both procedures.

g) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

If the DETACH REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an intra MME
handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon
successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit
the DETACH REQUEST message. If a failure of the handover procedure is
reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the
MME shall retransmit the DETACH REQUEST message.

5.5.3 Tracking area updating procedure (S1 mode only)

5.5.3.1 General

The tracking area updating procedure is always initiated by the UE and
is used for the following purposes:

- normal tracking area updating to update the registration of the actual
tracking area of a UE in the network;

- combined tracking area updating to update the registration of the
actual tracking area for a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of
operation;

- periodic tracking area updating to periodically notify the
availability of the UE to the network;

- IMSI attach for non-EPS services when the UE is attached for EPS
services. This procedure is used by a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2
of operation;

- in various cases of inter-system change from Iu mode to S1 mode or
from A/Gb mode to S1 mode;

- in various cases of inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode if the
UE operates in single-registration mode and as described in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54];

- S101 mode to S1 mode inter-system change;

- MME load balancing;

- to update certain UE specific parameters in the network;

- recovery from certain error cases;

- to indicate that the UE enters S1 mode after CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback;

- to indicate to the network that the UE has selected a CSG cell whose
CSG identity and associated PLMN identity are not included in the UE's
Allowed CSG list or in the UE's Operator CSG list;

- to indicate the current radio access technology to the network for the
support of terminating access domain selection for voice calls or voice
sessions;

- to indicate to the network that the UE has locally released EPS bearer
context(s);

- to indicate to the network that the MUSIM UE needs to use an IMSI
Offset value as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] that is used for
deriving the paging occasion as specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 [21];

- to indicate to the network the unavailability information or a change
in the unavailability information; and

- to indicate to the network that the UE needs to come out of the
unavailability period and resume normal services.

Details on the conditions for the UE to initiate the tracking area
updating procedure are specified in clause 5.5.3.2.2 and
clause 5.5.3.3.2.

If the MUSIM UE is attached for emergency bearer services and initiates
a tracking area updating procedure, the network shall not indicate the
support of:

- the NAS signalling connection release;

- the paging indication for voice services;

- the reject paging request;

- the paging restriction; or

- the paging timing collision control;

in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

While a UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the UE
shall not perform manual CSG selection.

If control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the UE, a UE
initiating the tracking area updating procedure in EMM-IDLE mode may
request the network to re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all
active EPS bearer contexts during the procedure. If control plane CIoT
EPS optimization is used by the UE, a UE initiating the tracking area
updating procedure in EMM-IDLE mode may request the network to
re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts
associated with PDN connections established without control plane only
indication during the procedure.

In a shared network, the UE shall choose one of the PLMN identities as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. The UE shall construct the TAI of the
cell from this chosen PLMN identity and the TAC received for this PLMN
identity on the broadcast system information. The chosen PLMN identity
shall be indicated to the E-UTRAN (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]). Whenever a
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with the EMM cause #11 "PLMN not
allowed" is received by the UE, the chosen PLMN identity shall be stored
in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if the UE is configured to use timer
T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE
shall start timer T3245 and proceed as described in clause 5.3.7a.
Whenever a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with the EMM cause #14
"EPS services not allowed in this PLMN" is received by the UE, the
chosen PLMN identity shall be stored in the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS
service". Whenever a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is received by
the UE with the EMM cause #12 "tracking area not allowed", #13 "roaming
not allowed in this tracking area", or #15 "no suitable cells in
tracking Area", the constructed TAI shall be stored in the suitable
list.

In a shared network, if TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT is received as a
response to a tracking area updating procedure initiated in
EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE need not update forbidden lists.

A tracking area updating attempt counter is used to limit the number of
subsequently rejected tracking area update attempts. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be incremented as specified in
clause 5.5.3.2.6. Depending on the value of the tracking area updating
attempt counter, specific actions shall be performed. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be reset when:

- a normal or periodic tracking area updating or a combined tracking
area updating procedure is successfully completed;

- a normal or periodic tracking area updating or a combined tracking
area updating procedure is rejected with EMM cause #11, #12, #13, #14,
#15, #25 or #35:

- a combined attach procedure or a combined tracking area updating
procedure is completed for EPS services only with cause #2 or #18; or

- a new PLMN is selected.

Additionally the tracking area updating attempt counter shall be reset
when the UE is in substate EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE or
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM, and:

- a new tracking area is entered;

- timer T3402 expires; or

- timer T3346 is started.

5.5.3.2 Normal and periodic tracking area updating procedure

5.5.3.2.1 General

The periodic tracking area updating procedure is controlled in the UE by
timer T3412. When timer T3412 expires and the UE is not registered for
emergency services, the periodic tracking area updating procedure is
started. Start and reset of timer T3412 is described in clause 5.3.5.

5.5.3.2.2 Normal and periodic tracking area updating procedure initiation

The UE in state EMM-REGISTERED shall initiate the tracking area updating
procedure by sending a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the MME,

a) when the UE detects that the current TAI is not in the list of
tracking areas that the UE previously registered in the MME, unless the
UE is configured for "AttachWithIMSI" as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17] and is entering a tracking
area in a new PLMN that is neither the registered PLMN nor in the list
of equivalent PLMNs;

b) when the periodic tracking area updating timer T3412 expires and the
UE is not registered for emergency services (see subclause 5.3.5);

c) when the UE enters EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and the UE's TIN
indicates "P-TMSI";

d) when the UE performs an inter-system change from S101 mode to S1 mode
and has no user data pending;

e) when the UE receives an indication from the lower layers that the RRC
connection was released with cause "load balancing TAU required";

f) when the UE deactivated EPS bearer context(s) locally while in
EMM-REGISTERED, because it could not establish a NAS signalling
connection, and then returns to EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE and no
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
or DETACH REQUEST message with detach type is "EPS detach" or "combined
EPS/IMSI detach" is pending to be sent by the UE;

g) when the UE changes any one of the UE network capability information,
the MS network capability information or the N1 UE network capability
information;

h) when the UE changes the UE specific DRX parameter (in WB-S1 mode or
NB-S1 mode);

i) when the UE receives an indication of "RRC Connection failure" from
the lower layers and has no signalling or user uplink data pending (i.e.
when the lower layer requests NAS signalling connection recovery);

j) when the UE enters S1 mode after 1xCS fallback or 1xSRVCC;

k) when due to manual CSG selection the UE has selected a CSG cell whose
CSG identity and associated PLMN identity are not included in the UE's
Allowed CSG list or in the UE's Operator CSG list;

l) when the UE reselects an E-UTRAN cell while it was in GPRS READY
state or PMM-CONNECTED mode;

m) when the UE supports SRVCC to GERAN or UTRAN or supports vSRVCC to
UTRAN and changes the mobile station classmark 2 or the supported
codecs, or the UE supports SRVCC to GERAN and changes the mobile station
classmark 3;

n) when the UE changes the radio capability for GERAN, or cdma2000^(®)
or both;

o) when the UE's usage setting or the voice domain preference for
E-UTRAN change in the UE;

NOTE 1: For the change of UE's usage setting or the voice domain
preference for E-UTRAN which results in disabling UE's E-UTRA
capability, the UE can skip sending TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message
and directly perform disabling of UE's E-UTRA capability.

p) when the UE activates mobility management for IMS voice termination
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], annex P.2, and the TIN indicates
"RAT-related TMSI";

q) when the UE performs an inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode
and the TIN indicates "RAT-related TMSI", but the UE is required to
perform tracking area updating for IMS voice termination as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13], annex P.4;

r) upon reception of a paging indication using S-TMSI and the UE is in
state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE;

NOTE 2: As an implementation option, the MUSIM UE is allowed to not
respond to paging based on the information available in the paging
message, e.g. voice service indication.

s) when the UE needs to update the network with EPS bearer context
status due to local de-activation of EPS bearer context(s) as specified
in clause 6.5.1.4A;

t) when the UE needs to request the use of PSM or needs to stop the use
of PSM;

u) when the UE needs to request the use of eDRX or needs to stop the use
of eDRX;

v) when a change in the eDRX usage conditions at the UE requires
different extended DRX parameters;

w) when a change in the PSM usage conditions at the UE requires a
different timer T3412 value or different timer T3324 value;

NOTE 3: A change in the PSM or eDRX usage conditions at the UE can
include e.g. a change in the UE configuration, a change in requirements
from upper layers or the battery running low at the UE.

x) when the CIoT EPS optimizations the UE needs to use, change in the
UE;

y) when the Default_DCN_ID value changes, as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17];

NOTE 4: The tracking area updating procedure is initiated after deleting
the DCN-ID list as specified in annex C.

z) when the UE performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in
EMM-IDLE mode, the UE operates in single-registration mode, and
conditions specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] apply;

za) when the UE in EMM-IDLE mode changes the radio capability for
E-UTRAN;

zb) when the UE needs to request new ciphering keys for ciphered
broadcast assistance data;

zc) when the UE in EMM-IDLE mode changes the radio capability for
NG-RAN;

zd) when the UE performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in
EMM-CONNECTED mode;

ze) in WB-S1 mode, when the UE has received a UE radio capability ID
deletion indication IE set to "Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs
deletion requested";

zf) when the UE needs to use the WUS assistance, stop to use the WUS
assistance, or change the conditions for using the WUS assistance;

zg) when the MUSIM UE needs to request an IMSI Offset value as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] that is used for deriving the paging occasion as
specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]; or

zh) when the UE in EMM-IDLE mode needs to inform the network that a UE
radio capability information update is required due to a cell change
between E-UTRAN and satellite E-UTRAN cells.

If case b) is the only reason for initiating the normal and periodic
tracking area updating procedure, the UE shall indicate "periodic
updating" in the EPS update type IE; otherwise the UE shall indicate "TA
updating".

For cases n, za, zc and zh the UE shall include a UE radio capability
information update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message.

NOTE 4a: For cases n, za, zc and zh if the UE supports RACS irrespective
whether the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE
radio configuration in the selected PLMN the UE radio capability
information update needed IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message.

If the UE is in the EMM-CONNECTED mode and the UE changes the radio
capability for E-UTRAN or for NG-RAN, the UE may locally release the
established NAS signalling connection and enter the EMM-IDLE mode. Then,
the UE shall initiate the tracking area updating procedure including a
UE radio capability information update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message.

For case l, if the TIN indicates "RAT-related TMSI", the UE shall set
the TIN to "P-TMSI" before initiating the tracking area updating
procedure.

For case r, the "active" flag in the EPS update type IE shall be set
to 1. If a UE is only using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the "signalling active" flag in the Additional update type
IE shall be set to 1.

If the UE is using only control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the case i
only applies to the case that the UE has indicated to the network that
subsequent to the uplink data transmission a downlink data transmission
is expected during the transport of uplink user data via the control
plane procedure (see clause 6.6.4).

If the UE has to request resources for ProSe direct discovery or Prose
direct communication (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), then the UE shall set
the "active" flag to 1 in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

If the UE does not have any established PDN connection, and the
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode is not due to emergency
services fallback, the "active" flag in the EPS update type IE shall be
set to 0.

When the UE has user data pending and performs an inter-system change
from S101 mode to S1 mode to a tracking area included in the TAI list
stored in the UE, the UE shall perform a service request procedure
instead of a tracking area updating procedure.

When initiating a tracking area updating procedure while in S1 mode, the
UE shall use the current EPS NAS integrity key to integrity protect the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, unless the UE is performing
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode.

In order to indicate its UE specific DRX parameter for WB-S1 mode while
in E-UTRAN coverage, the UE shall send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message containing the UE specific DRX parameter in the DRX parameter IE
to the network, with the exception of the case if the UE had indicated
its DRX parameter for WB-S1 mode (3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) to the network
while in GERAN or UTRAN coverage. In this case, when the UE enters
E-UTRAN coverage and initiates a tracking area updating procedure, the
UE shall not include the UE specific DRX parameter in the DRX parameter
IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

In NB-S1 mode, a UE that wishes to use or change a UE specific DRX
parameter in NB-S1 mode shall include its requested value in every
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message except when initiating the periodic
tracking area updating procedure.

If the UE supports eDRX and requests the use of eDRX, the UE shall
include the extended DRX parameters IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message.

If the UE supports PSM and requests the use of PSM, the UE shall include
the T3324 value IE with a requested timer value in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message. When the UE includes the T3324 value IE and the
UE indicates support for extended periodic timer value in the MS network
feature support IE, it may also include the T3412 extended value IE to
request a particular T3412 value to be allocated.

If a UE supporting CIoT EPS optimizations in NB-S1 mode initiates the
tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only", the UE
shall indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE and shall set
the EPS update type IE to "TA updating".

If the UE supports enhanced discontinuous coverage, then the UE shall
set the EDC bit to "Enhanced discontinuous coverage supported" in the UE
network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

If the network has indicated support for enhanced discontinuous coverage
and needs to indicate upcoming availability due to discontinuous
coverage, the UE shall include the Unavailability information IE in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The UE shall set the
unavailability type in the Unavailability information IE to
"unavailability due to discontinuous coverage". The UE may include the
unavailability period duration or the time to the start of the
unavailability period or both in the Unavailability information IE.

If the UE supports S1-U data transfer and multiple user plane radio
bearers (see 3GPP TS 36.306 [44], 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) in NB-S1 mode,
then the UE shall set the Multiple DRB support bit to "Multiple DRB
supported" in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message.

procedure, or uplink signalling not related to the tracking area
updating procedure when the UE does not support control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, it may set the "active" flag in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message to indicate the request to establish the user plane to
the network and to keep the NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

If a UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization
and has user data pending to be sent via control plane over MME but no

Figure 5.5.3.2.2.1: Tracking area updating procedure

5.5.3.2.3 EMM common procedure initiation

If the network receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message
containing the Old GUTI type IE, and the network does not follow the use
of the most significant bit of the <MME group id> to distinguish the
node type as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [2], clause 2.8.2.2.2, the
network shall use the Old GUTI type IE to determine whether the mobile
identity included in the Old GUTI IE is a native GUTI or a mapped GUTI.

During the tracking area updating procedure, the MME may initiate EMM
common procedures, e.g. the EMM authentication and security mode control
procedures.

The MME may be configured to skip the authentication procedure even if
no EPS security context is available and proceed directly to the
execution of the security mode control procedure as specified in
clause 5.4.3, during a tracking area updating procedure for a UE that
has only a PDN connection for emergency bearer services or for RLOS.

The MME shall not initiate an EMM authentication procedure before
completion of the tracking area updating procedure, if the following
conditions apply:

a) the UE initiated the tracking area updating procedure after handover
or inter-system handover to S1 mode;

b) the target cell is a shared network cell; and

- the UE has provided its GUTI in the Old GUTI IE or the Additional GUTI
IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the PLMN identity
included in the GUTI is different from the selected PLMN identity of the
target cell; or

- the UE has mapped the P-TMSI and RAI into the Old GUTI IE and not
included an Additional GUTI IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message, and the PLMN identity included in the RAI is different from the
selected PLMN identity of the target cell.

5.5.3.2.4 Normal and periodic tracking area updating procedure accepted by the network

If the tracking area update request has been accepted by the network,
the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message to the UE. If
the MME assigns a new GUTI for the UE, a GUTI shall be included in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the MME includes the GUTI IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MME shall start timer T3450
and enter state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as described in
clause 5.4.1. The MME may include a new TAI list for the UE in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall not assign a TAI list
containing both tracking areas in NB-S1 mode and tracking areas in WB-S1
mode.

NOTE 1: When assigning the TAI list, the MME can take into account the
eNodeB's capability of support of CIoT EPS optimization.

If the UE has included the UE network capability IE or the MS network
capability IE or both in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the
MME shall store all octets received from the UE, up to the maximum
length defined for the respective information element.

NOTE 2: This information is forwarded to the new MME during inter-MME
handover or to the new SGSN during inter-system handover to A/Gb mode or
Iu mode.

NOTE 3: For further details concerning the handling of the MS network
capability and UE network capability in the MME see also
3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

In NB-S1 mode, if the tracking area update request is accepted by the
network, the MME shall set the EMC BS bit to zero in the EPS network
feature support IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
to indicate that support of emergency bearer services in NB-S1 mode is
not available.

If a UE radio capability information update needed IE is included in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete the stored UE
radio capability information or the UE radio capability ID, if any.

If the UE specific DRX parameter was included in the DRX Parameter IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the network shall replace any
stored UE specific DRX parameter with the received parameter and use it
for the downlink transfer of signalling and user data in WB-S1 mode.

In NB-S1 mode, if the DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE was included in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall provide to the UE
the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall replace any stored UE specific DRX
parameter in NB-S1 mode with the negotiated DRX parameter and use it for
the downlink transfer of signalling and user data in NB-S1 mode.

NOTE 4: In NB-S1 mode, if a DRX parameter was included in the Negotiated
DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message, then the UE stores and uses the received DRX parameter in NB-S1
mode (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]). If the UE has included the DRX parameter
in NB-S1 mode IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, but did
not receive a DRX parameter in the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1
mode IE, or if the Negotiated DRX parameter in NB-S1 mode IE was not
included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the UE uses
the cell specific DRX value in NB-S1 mode (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]).If
the UE requests "control plane CIoT EPS optimization" in the Additional
update type IE, indicates support of control plane CIoT EPS optimization
in the UE network capability IE and the MME decides to accept the
requested CIoT EPS optimization and the tracking area update request,
the MME shall indicate "control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported"
in the EPS network feature support IE.

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update
type IE, supports NB-S1 mode only and the MME decides to accept the
tracking area update request for EPS services and "SMS only", the MME
shall indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update result IE and shall
set the EPS update type IE to "TA updating" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message.

The MME shall include the extended DRX parameters IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message only if the extended DRX parameters IE was
included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME
supports and accepts the use of eDRX.

If:

- the UE supports WUS assistance; and

- the MME supports and accepts the use of WUS assistance,

then the MME shall determine the negotiated UE paging probability
information for the UE, store it in the EMM context of the UE, and if
the UE is not attaching for emergency bearer services, the MME shall
include it in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE and assign a
new GUTI in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME may take
into account the UE paging probability information received in the
Requested WUS assistance information IE when determining the negotiated
UE paging probability information for the UE. If the UE has not included
Requested WUS assistance information IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message and the MME has stored a negotiated UE paging
probability information for that UE, the MME shall erase the negotiated
UE paging probability information and assign a new GUTI in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

NOTE 5: Besides the UE paging probability information requested by the
UE, the MME can take local configuration or previous statistical
information for the UE into account when determining the negotiated UE
paging probability information for the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

If the UE indicates support for EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports
EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, the MME shall indicate this in
the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message. The UE and the MME shall use the information whether the peer
entity supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection as specified in
the present clause 5 and in clause 6.

If the UE indicates support for enhanced discontinuous coverage in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports enhanced
discontinuous coverage, the MME shall indicate "Enhanced discontinuous
coverage supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE provided the Unavailability information IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then:

a) the MME shall determine the unavailability period duration value as:

- a value that was provided by the UE; or

- a value that was determined by the MME based on satellite coverage
availability information; and

the MME shall store the determined unavailability period duration and
provide the determined unavailability period duration to the UE by
including the Unavailability period duration IE in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message;

b) the MME shall store the start of unavailability period value. If the
UE did not include a start of the unavailability period, the MME shall
consider the start of unavailability period to be the time at which MME
received the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message from the UE. The MME
shall consider the UE as unreachable until the UE initiates the tracking
area updating procedure for normal service again without providing an
unavailability information; and

c) release the NAS signalling connection immediately after the
completion of the tracking area updating procedure in which the UE
provided unavailability information without providing the start of the
unavailability period.

The MME should determine the periodic tracking area update timer, mobile
reachable timer and implicit detach timer value based on:

a) the stored value of the received unavailability period duration or
based on a network determined unavailability period duration when the
unavailability period duration is not provided by the UE;

b) the stored value of the received start of unavailability period or
based on a network determined start of unavailability period when the
start of unavailability period is not provided by the UE; or

c) any combination of the above.

If the UE does not provide the Unavailability information IE in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored
value of the Unavailability information IE if exists.

If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall deactivate all those EPS bearer
contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the MME and
the UE) which are in ESM state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE or BEARER CONTEXT
MODIFY PENDING on the network side, but are indicated by the UE as being
in ESM state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE. If a default EPS bearer context is
marked as inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and this default bearer is not
associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME,
the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to
the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without
peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default bearer is
associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME,
and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated
to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context without
peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default EPS bearer context
of a PDN connection established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU
session as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 24.193 [61] is deactivated
locally and the MA PDU session does not have user plane resources
established on non-3GPP access in N1 mode, the network shall perform a
local release of the MA PDU session.

If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST, the MME shall include an EPS bearer context status IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, indicating which EPS bearer
contexts are active in the MME except for the case no EPS bearer context
exists on the network side.

If the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message indicates "periodic updating", and the UE was previously
successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services, subject to operator
policies the MME should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than
one location area.

The MME shall indicate "combined TA/LA updated" or "combined TA/LA
updated and ISR activated" in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, if the following conditions apply:

- the EPS update type IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message indicates "periodic updating" and the UE was previously
successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS services; and

- location area updating for non-EPS services as specified in
3GPP TS 29.118 [16A] is successful.

The MME may include T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message only if the UE indicates support of the extended periodic
timer T3412 in the MS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message.

The MME shall include the T3324 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message only if the T3324 value IE was included in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports and accepts the use of
PSM.

If the MME supports and accepts the use of PSM, and the UE included the
T3412extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, then
the MME shall take into account the T3412 value requested when providing
the T3412 value IE and the T3412 extended value IE in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message.

NOTE 6: Besides the value requested by the MS, the MME can take local
configuration or subscription data provided by the HSS into account when
selecting a value for T3412 (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] clause 4.3.17.3).

If the MME includes the T3324 value IE indicating a value other than
deactivated in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, then the MME
shall indicate in the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message that ISR is not activated.

Also, during the tracking area updating procedure without the "active"
flag set, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) locally for
any reason, the MME shall inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer
context(s) by including the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

Also, during the tracking area updating procedure with the "active" flag
set, if the MME has deactivated EPS bearer context(s) associated with
control plane only indication locally for any reason, the MME shall
inform the UE of the deactivated EPS bearer context(s) by including the
EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the DCN-ID IE, then
the UE shall store the included DCN-ID value together with the PLMN code
of the registered PLMN in a DCN-ID list in a non-volatile memory in the
ME as specified in annex C.

If due to regional subscription restrictions or access restrictions the
UE is not allowed to access the TA, but it has a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services established, the MME may accept the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearer
contexts by initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure when
the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-CONNECTED mode.
When the tracking area updating procedure is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode,
the MME locally deactivates all non-emergency EPS bearer contexts and
informs the UE via the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message. The MME shall not deactivate the emergency EPS
bearer contexts. The network shall consider the UE to be attached for
emergency bearer services only and shall indicate in the EPS update
result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is not
activated.

If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a
LIPA PDN connection, and if:

- a GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided
by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the
LIPA PDN Connection is different from the provided GW Transport Layer
Address IE value (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

- no GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer,

then the MME locally deactivates all EPS bearer contexts associated with
the LIPA PDN connection. Furthermore, the MME takes one of the following
actions:

- if no active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE, the MME shall not
accept the tracking area update request as specified in
clause 5.5.3.2.5;

- if active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE and the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message is accepted, the MME informs the UE via the EPS
bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that
EPS bearer contexts were locally deactivated.

If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received from a UE with a
SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, is accepted by the network,
the following different cases can be distinguished:

1) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection
with collocated L-GW and if:

- a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is
provided by the lower layer together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message, and the P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context
of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the
provided SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see
3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

- no SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by the lower layer,

2) If the PDN connection is a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection
with stand-alone GW and if:

- a LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the LHN-ID stored in the EPS
bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is
different from the provided LHN-ID value (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

- no LHN-ID value is provided together with the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message by the lower layer,

then the MME takes one of the following actions:

- if the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining
PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
not supported by the UE or the MME, then the MME shall upon completion
of the tracking area updating procedure detach the UE by using detach
type "re-attach required" (see clause 5.5.2.3.1);

- if the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is the last remaining
PDN connection for the UE, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
supported by the UE and the MME, then the MME shall upon completion of
the tracking area updating procedure initiate an EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure with ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" for
the default EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection (see clause 6.4.4.2); and

- if a PDN connection remains that is not SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection, the MME shall upon completion of the tracking area updating
procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with ESM
cause #39 "reactivation requested" for the default EPS bearer context of
each SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see clause 6.4.4.2);

For a SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW, the
conditions to deactivate ISR are specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10],
clause 4.3.5.6.

For a shared network, the TAIs included in the TAI list can contain
different PLMN identities. The MME indicates the selected core network
operator PLMN identity to the UE in the GUTI (see 3GPP TS 23.251 [8B]).

If the "active" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message
and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME, the MME
shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer
contexts. If the "active" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the
MME, the MME shall re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active
EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN connections established without
Control plane only indication.

If the "signalling active" flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is used by the
MME, the MME shall not immediately release the NAS signalling connection
after the completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

If the "active" flag is not set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message and control plane CIoT EPS optimization is not used by the MME,
the MME may also re-establish the radio and S1 bearers for all active
EPS bearer contexts due to downlink pending data or downlink pending
signalling, except for the case when the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message includes the UE request type IE and the Request type is set to
"NAS signalling connection release". If the "active" flag is not set in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and control plane CIoT EPS
optimization is used by the MME, the MME may also re-establish the radio
and S1 bearers for all active EPS bearer contexts associated with PDN
connections established without Control plane only indication due to
downlink pending data or downlink pending signalling, except for the
case when the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message includes the UE
request type IE and the Request type is set to "NAS signalling
connection release".

If the MME supports NB-S1 mode, non-IP or Ethernet PDN type,
inter-system change with 5GS, UAS services or the network wants to
enforce the use of DNS over (D)TLS (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [24]), then the
MME shall support the Extended protocol configuration options IE.

NOTE 7: Support of DNS over (D)TLS is based on the informative
requirements as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19] and it is implemented
based on the operator requirement.

If the MME supports the Extended protocol configuration options IE and
the UE indicated support of the Extended protocol configuration options
IE, then the MME shall set the ePCO bit to "extended protocol
configuration options supported" in the EPS network feature support IE
of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage
in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the network decides to
restrict the use of enhanced coverage for the UE, then the MME shall set
the RestrictEC bit to "Use of enhanced coverage is restricted" in the
EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

The MME may indicate the header compression configuration status IE in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message for each established EPS bearer
context using control plane CIoT EPS optimisation.

If the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off
timer, and the MME decides to activate the congestion control for
transport of user data via the control plane, then the MME shall include
the T3448 value IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support for dual connectivity with NR in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME decides to restrict
the use of dual connectivity with NR for the UE, then the MME shall set
the RestrictDCNR bit to "Use of dual connectivity with NR is restricted"
in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

If the UE indicates support for N1 mode in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message and the MME supports inter-system interworking with 5GS,
the MME may set the IWK N26 bit to either:

- "interworking without N26 interface not supported" if the MME supports
N26 interface; or

- "interworking without N26 interface supported" if the MME does not
support N26 interface

in the EPS network feature support IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message.

If the MME determines the UE's N1 mode capability for 3GPP access
changes from " N1 mode for 3GPP access not supported " to " N1 mode for
3GPP access supported " and the network decides to enable the transfer
of a PDN connection not supporting interworking to 5GS from S1 mode to
N1 mode, the MME may upon completion of the tracking area updating
procedure initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure to
deactivate the default EPS bearer context of the PDN connection by
including ESM cause #39 "reactivation requested" in the DEACTIVATE EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message (see clause 6.4.4.2).

The MME shall set the redir-policy bit to "Unsecured redirection to
GERAN or UTRAN not allowed" in the Network policy IE of the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message if unsecured redirection to a GERAN or UTRAN
cell is not allowed in the current PLMN. Otherwise, the redir-policy bit
shall be set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN or UTRAN allowed".

If the UE has indicated support for service gap control, a service gap
time value is available in the EMM context, the MME may include the
T3447 value IE set to the service gap time value in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the network supports signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer
contexts and the UE indicated support of signalling for a maximum number
of 15 EPS bearer contexts in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message,
then the MME shall set the 15 bearers bit to "Signalling for a maximum
number of 15 EPS bearer contexts supported" in the EPS network feature
support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support of the NAS signalling connection release in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to
accept the NAS signalling connection release, then the MME shall set the
NAS signalling connection release bit to "NAS signalling connection
release supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support of the paging indication for voice services
in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to
accept the paging indication for voice services, then the MME shall set
the paging indication for voice services bit to "paging indication for
voice services supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE receives the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with the paging indication for voice services
bit set to "paging indication for voice services supported", the UE NAS
layer informs the lower layers that paging indication for voice services
is supported. Otherwise, the UE NAS layer informs the lower layers that
paging indication for voice services is not supported.

If the UE indicates support of the reject paging request in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to accept the reject
paging request, then the MME shall set the reject paging request bit to
"reject paging request supported" in the EPS network feature support IE
of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support of the paging restriction in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME sets:

- the reject paging request bit to "reject paging request supported";

- the NAS signalling connection release bit to "NAS signalling
connection release supported"; or

- both of them;

in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message, and the network decides to accept the paging restriction, then
the MME shall set the paging restriction bit to "paging restriction
supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE indicates support of the paging timing collision control in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the network decides to
accept the paging timing collision control, then the MME shall set the
paging timing collision control bit to "paging timing collision control
supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE requests ciphering keys for ciphered broadcast assistance data
in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME has valid
ciphering key data applicable to the UE's subscription, then the MME
shall include the ciphering key data in the Ciphering key data IE of the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the MUSIM UE does not include the Paging restriction IE in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored
paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging.

If the MUSIM UE has included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the EPS update type IE not indicating
"periodic updating" and if the MME supports paging timing collision
control, the MME shall include the Negotiated IMSI offset IE and assign
a new GUTI in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the MME shall
set the IMSI offset value to:

- A value that is different than what the UE has provided, if the MME
has a different value; or

- A value that is same as what the UE has provided, if the MME does not
have a different value;

and the MME shall calculate an alternative IMSI value using the IMSI
offset value and store it in the UE context as specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. The alternative IMSI value is used for deriving the
paging occasion as specified in 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

If the MUSIM UE has not included a Requested IMSI offset IE in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with the EPS update type IE not
indicating "periodic updating" and the MME has stored an alternative
IMSI value for that UE, the MME shall erase the alternative IMSI value
and assign a new GUTI in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the MUSIM UE requests the release of the NAS signalling connection,
by setting Request type to "NAS signalling connection release" in the UE
request type IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME
supports the NAS signalling connection release, the MME shall initiate
the release of the NAS signalling connection after the completion of the
tracking area updating procedure. If the UE requests restriction of
paging by including the Paging restriction IE in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message and the MME supports the paging restriction, the
MME:

- if accepts the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional
request result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the
Paging restriction decision to "paging restriction is accepted". The MME
shall store the paging restriction of the UE and enforce these
restrictions in the paging procedure as described in clause 5.6.2; or

- if rejects the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional
request result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and set the
Paging restriction decision to "paging restriction is rejected", and
shall discard the received paging restriction. The MME shall delete any
stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging.

Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop
timer T3430, reset the service request attempt counter, tracking area
updating attempt counter, enter state EMM-REGISTERED and set the EPS
update status to EU1 UPDATED. If the message contains a GUTI, the UE
shall use this GUTI as new temporary identity for EPS services and shall
store the new GUTI. If no GUTI was included by the MME in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old GUTI shall be used. If the UE
receives a new TAI list in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the
UE shall consider the new TAI list as valid and the old TAI list as
invalid; otherwise, the UE shall consider the old TAI list as valid.

If the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message from a PLMN
for which a PLMN-specific attempt counter or PLMN-specific PS-attempt
counter is maintained (see clause 5.3.7b), then the UE shall reset these
counters. If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid
for GPRS services", then the UE shall reset this counter.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3412 extended
value IE, then the UE shall use the T3412 extended value IE as periodic
tracking area update timer (T3412). If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
contains T3412 value IE, but not T3412 extended value IE, then the UE
shall use value in T3412 value IE as periodic tracking area update timer
(T3412). If neither T3412 value IE nor T3412 extended value IE is
included, the UE shall use the value currently stored, e.g. from a prior
ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3324 value IE,
then the UE shall use the timer value for T3324 as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13], clause 4.7.2.8.

If the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure in EMM-IDLE
mode to perform an inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1
mode and the nonce_(UE) was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message, the UE shall delete the nonce_(UE) upon receipt of the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall deactivate all those EPS bearers
contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the
MME) which are active in the UE, but are indicated by the MME as being
inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the
EPS bearer context status IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT
message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last
remaining PDN connection in the UE, the UE shall locally deactivate all
EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default
EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME. If
only the PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains
established, the UE shall consider itself attached for emergency bearer
services only. If the default bearer is associated with the last
remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED
without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall
locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN
connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM
signalling to the UE. If the default EPS bearer context of a PDN
connection established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU session as
specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 24.193 [61] is deactivated locally
and the MA PDU session does not have user plane resources established on
non-3GPP access in N1 mode, the UE shall perform a local release of the
MA PDU session.

If an EPS bearer context status IE is included in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE may choose to ignore all those EPS bearers
which are indicated by the MME as being active but are inactive at the
UE.

If the tracking area updating procedure is initiated following an
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode and only the PDN connection
for emergency bearer services is established, the UE should consider
itself attached for emergency bearer services only.

If a Negotiated IMSI offset IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message, the MUSIM UE shall forward the IMSI offset value to
lower layers. If a Negotiated IMSI offset IE is not included in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the EPS update type IE included
in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message does not indicate "periodic
updating", the MUSIM UE shall indicate to lower layers to erase any IMSI
offset value, if available.

The MME may also include a list of equivalent PLMNs in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message. Each entry in the list contains a PLMN code
(MCC+MNC). The UE shall store the list as provided by the network, and
if there is no PDN connection for emergency bearer services or PDN
connection for RLOS established, the UE shall remove from the list any
PLMN code that is already in the list of "forbidden PLMNs" or in the
list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service". If the UE is not attached
for emergency bearer services and there is a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services established, the UE shall remove from the list
of equivalent PLMNs any PLMN code present in the list of forbidden PLMNs
or in the list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" when the PDN
connection for emergency bearer services is released. In addition, the
UE shall add to the stored list the PLMN code of the registered PLMN
that sent the list. The UE shall replace the stored list on each receipt
of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message does not contain a list, then the UE shall delete the
stored list.

If the UE is neither attached for emergency bearer services nor attached
for access to RLOS, and if the PLMN identity of the registered PLMN is a
member of the list of "forbidden PLMNs" or the list of "forbidden PLMNs
for GPRS service", any such PLMN identity shall be deleted from the
corresponding list(s).

The network may also indicate in the EPS update result IE in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that ISR is active. If the UE is
attached for emergency bearer services, the network shall indicate in
the EPS update result IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that
ISR is not activated. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
contains:

i) no indication that ISR is activated, the UE shall set the TIN to
"GUTI" and shall stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or
T3323, if running;

ii) an indication that ISR is activated, then:

- if the UE is required to perform routing area updating for IMS voice
termination as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], annex P.5, the UE shall
set the TIN to "GUTI" and shall stop the periodic routing area update
timer T3312 or T3323, if running;

- if the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a
change in UE network capability or change in DRX parameters, the UE
shall set the TIN to "GUTI" and shall stop the periodic routing area
update timer T3312 or T3323, if running;

- if the UE had initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to a
change in the UE's usage setting or the voice domain preference for
E-UTRAN, the UE shall set the TIN to "GUTI" and shall stop the periodic
routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running; or

- the UE shall regard a previously assigned P-TMSI and RAI as valid and
registered with the network. If the TIN currently indicates "P-TMSI" and
the periodic routing area update timer T3312 is running or is
deactivated, the UE shall set the TIN to "RAT-related TMSI". If the TIN
currently indicates "P-TMSI" and the periodic routing area update timer
T3312 has already expired, the UE shall set the TIN to "GUTI".

The network informs the UE about the support of specific features, such
as IMS voice over PS session, location services (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS),
emergency bearer services, or CIoT EPS optimizations, in the EPS network
feature support information element. In a UE with IMS voice over PS
capability, the IMS voice over PS session indicator and the emergency
bearer services indicator shall be provided to the upper layers. The
upper layers take the IMS voice over PS session indicator into account
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.221 [8A], clause 7.2a and clause 7.2b, when
selecting the access domain for voice sessions or calls. When initiating
an emergency call, the upper layers also take both the IMS voice over PS
session indicator and the emergency bearer services indicator into
account for the access domain selection. When the UE determines via the
IMS voice over PS session indicator that the network does not support
IMS voice over PS sessions in S1 mode, then the UE shall not locally
release any persistent EPS bearer context. When the UE determines via
the emergency bearer services indicator that the network does not
support emergency bearer services in S1 mode, then the UE shall not
locally release any emergency EPS bearer context if there is a radio
bearer associated with that context. In a UE with LCS capability,
location services indicators (EPC-LCS, CS-LCS) shall be provided to the
upper layers. When MO-LR procedure is triggered by the UE's application,
those indicators are taken into account as specified in
3GPP TS 24.171 [13C].

If the MME received the list of TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as
described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], and determines that, by UE
subscription and operator's preferences, any but not all TAIs in the
received list of TAIs is forbidden for roaming or for regional provision
of service as per operator's choice, the MME shall include the TAI(s)
in:

a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" IE;

b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service" IE; or

c) both,

in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

NOTE 8: Void.

If the RestrictDCNR bit is set to "Use of dual connectivity with NR is
restricted" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall provide the indication that dual
connectivity with NR is restricted to the upper layers.

The UE supporting N1 mode shall operate in the mode for inter-system
interworking with 5GS as follows:

- if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to
"interworking without N26 interface not supported", the UE shall operate
in single-registration mode;

- if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to
"interworking without N26 interface supported" and the UE supports
dual-registration mode, the UE may operate in dual-registration mode; or

NOTE 9: The registration mode used by the UE is implementation
dependent.

- if the IWK N26 bit in the EPS network feature support IE is set to
"interworking without N26 interface supported" and the UE only supports
single-registration mode, the UE shall operate in single-registration
mode.

The UE shall treat the interworking without N26 interface indicator as
valid in the entire PLMN and equivalent PLMNs. The interworking
procedures required for coordination between 5GMM and EMM without N26
interface are specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

If the redir-policy bit is set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN or
UTRAN not allowed" in the Network policy IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on unsecured
redirection to GERAN for the current PLMN to "Unsecured redirection to
GERAN or UTRAN not allowed" and indicate to the lower layers that
unsecured redirection to a GERAN or UTRAN cell is not allowed. If the
redir-policy bit is set to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN or UTRAN
allowed" or if the Network policy IE is not included in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall set the network policy on
unsecured redirection to GERAN or UTRAN for the current PLMN to
"Unsecured redirection to GERAN or UTRAN allowed" and indicate to the
lower layers that unsecured redirection to a GERAN or UTRAN cell is
allowed. The UE shall set the network policy on unsecured redirection to
GERAN or UTRAN to "Unsecured redirection to GERAN or UTRAN not allowed"
and indicate this to the lower layers when any of the following events
occurs:

- the UE initiates an EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure in
a PLMN different from the PLMN where the UE performed the last
successful EPS attach or tracking area updating procedure;

- the UE is switched on; or

- the UICC containing the USIM is removed.

If the UE has initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to
manual CSG selection and receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message,
and the UE sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in a CSG cell,
the UE shall check if the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the
cell where the UE has sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message are
contained in the Allowed CSG list. If not, the UE shall add that CSG ID
and associated PLMN identity to the Allowed CSG list and the UE may add
the HNB Name (if provided by lower layers) to the Allowed CSG list if
the HNB Name is present in neither the Operator CSG list nor the Allowed
CSG list.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contained a GUTI, the UE
shall return a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the MME to
acknowledge the received GUTI or the received Negotiated IMSI offset IE.
If the UE has a negotiated IMSI offset value stored at the lower layers
and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain the
Negotiated IMSI offset IE, the UE shall return a TRACKING AREA UPDATE
COMPLETE message to the MME, and the MME shall erase the stored
alternative IMSI value for the UE upon receiving the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE COMPLETE message.

If the UE which was previously successfully attached for EPS and non-EPS
services receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message with EPS
update result IE indicating "combined TA/LA updated" or "combined TA/LA
updated and ISR activated" as the response of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message with EPS update type IE indicating "periodic updating",
the UE shall behave as follows:

- If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an IMSI, the UE is
not allocated any TMSI, and shall delete any old TMSI accordingly.

- If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a TMSI, the UE
shall use this TMSI as new temporary identity. The UE shall delete its
old TMSI and shall store the new TMSI. In this case, a TRACKING AREA
UPDATE COMPLETE message is returned to the network to confirm the
received TMSI.

- If neither a TMSI nor an IMSI has been included by the network in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old TMSI, if any is available,
shall be kept.

If the header compression configuration status is included in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE shall stop using header
compression and decompression for those EPS bearers using Control plane
CIoT EPS optimisation for which the MME indicated that the header
compression configuration is not used.

If the T3448 value IE is present in the received TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message, the UE shall:

- stop timer T3448 if it is running; and

- start timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE.

If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or
deactivated, the UE shall consider this case as an abnormal case and
proceed as if the T3448 value IE is not present.

If the UE in EMM-IDLE mode initiated the tracking area updating
procedure and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not include
the T3448 value IE and if timer T3448 is running, then the UE shall stop
timer T3448.

If the UE has indicated "service gap control supported" in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and:

- the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains the T3447 value IE,
then the UE shall store the new T3447 value, erase any previous stored
T3447 value if exists and use the new T3447 value with the T3447 timer
next time it is started; or

- the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message does not contain the T3447
value IE, then the UE shall erase any previous stored T3447 value if
exists and stop the T3447 timer if running.

Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, the MME shall
stop timer T3450 and change to state EMM-REGISTERED. The GUTI, the
Negotiated IMSI offset, or both, if sent in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message, shall be considered as valid.

NOTE 10: Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, if a
new TMSI was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the
MME sends an SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in
3GPP TS 29.118 [16A].

For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode
in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has included an eKSI in the NAS Key Set
Identifier IE indicating a current EPS security context in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by which the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message is integrity protected, the MME shall take one of the following
actions:

- if the MME retrieves the current EPS security context as indicated by
the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, the MME shall integrity check the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using the current EPS security
context and integrity protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
using the current EPS security context;

- if the MME cannot retrieve the current EPS security context as
indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, and if the UE has
included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence number, the MME shall
create a new mapped EPS security context as specified in
3GPP TS 33.401 [19], and then perform a security mode control procedure
to indicate the use of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE
(see clause 5.4.3.2); or

- if the UE has not included an Additional GUTI IE, the MME may treat
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as in the previous item, i.e.
as if it cannot retrieve the current EPS security context.

NOTE 11: The handling described above at failure to retrieve the current
EPS security context or if no Additional GUTI IE was provided does not
preclude the option for the MME to perform an EPS authentication
procedure and create a new native EPS security context.

For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode
in EMM-IDLE mode, if the UE has not included a valid eKSI in the NAS Key
Set Identifier IE and has included a valid GPRS ciphering key sequence
number in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the MME shall create
a new mapped EPS security context as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19],
and then perform a security mode control procedure to indicate the use
of the new mapped EPS security context to the UE (see clause 5.4.3.2).

NOTE 12: This does not preclude the option for the MME to perform an EPS
authentication procedure and create a new native EPS security context.

For inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode, if the
UE has included an eKSI in the NAS Key Set Identifier IE indicating a 5G
NAS security context in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message by
which the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is integrity protected,
the MME shall take actions as specified in clause 4.4.2.3.

For inter-system change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode
in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall integrity check TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message using the current K'_(ASME) as derived when
triggering the handover to E-UTRAN (see clause 4.4.2.2). The MME shall
verify the received UE security capabilities in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message. The MME shall then take one of the following actions:

- if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST does not contain a valid
KSI_(ASME) in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME
shall remove the non-current native EPS security context, if any, for
any GUTI for this UE. The MME shall then integrity protect and cipher
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the security context based
on K'_(ASME) and take the mapped EPS security context into use; or

- if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST contains a valid KSI_(ASME) in the
Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME may initiate a
security mode control procedure to take the corresponding native EPS
security context into use.

For inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-CONNECTED mode,
the MME shall integrity check TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message using
the current K'_(ASME) as derived when triggering the handover to E-UTRAN
(see clause 4.4.2.2). The MME shall verify the received UE security
capabilities in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. The MME shall
then take one of the following actions:

- if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST does not contain a valid
KSI_(ASME) in the Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME
shall remove the non-current native EPS security context, if any, for
any GUTI for this UE. The MME shall then integrity protect and cipher
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message using the security context based
on K'_(ASME) and take the mapped EPS security context into use; or

- if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST contains a valid KSI_(ASME) in the
Non-current native NAS key set identifier IE, the MME may initiate a
security mode control procedure to take the corresponding native EPS
security context into use.

In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to "RACS supported" in the
UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message,
the MME may include a UE radio capability ID IE or a UE radio capability
ID deletion indication IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message. In
this case the MME shall enter state EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED as
described in clause 5.4.1.

In WB-S1 mode, if the UE has set the RACS bit to "RACS supported" in the
UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes:

- a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to
"Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested", the UE
shall:

a) delete any network-assigned UE radio capability IDs associated with
the registered PLMN stored at the UE;

b) send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the network to
acknowledge the received UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE;
and

c) after the completion of the ongoing tracking area updating procedure,
initiate a tracking area updating procedure as specified in clause 5.5.3
over the existing NAS signalling connection except if there is a pending
service request procedure as response to paging for CS fallback; or

- a UE radio capability ID IE, the UE shall:

a) store the UE radio capability ID as specified in annex C; and

b) send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message to the network to
acknowledge the received UE radio capability ID IE.

If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming" IE in the TRACKING ARE UPDATE ACCEPT message
and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part of the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in
the IE which are belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s)
into the list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming", ignore the
TAI(s) which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) and
remove the TAI(s) from the stored TAI list if present.

If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE is not part
of the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE which are
belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) into the list of
"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service", ignore the
TAI(s) which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) and
remove the TAI(s) from the stored TAI list if present.

NOTE 13: For the UE supporting non-IP or Ethernet PDN type or UAS
services, if the UE receives the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and
the ePCO bit in the EPS network feature support IE is not set to
"extended protocol configuration options supported", the UE can perform
a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] with the current PLMN
considered as the lowest priority after the completion of the tracking
area update procedure.

If for discontinuous coverage, the UE receives the Unavailability
configuration IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and the End
of unavailability report bit is set to "UE does not need to report end
of unavailability", the UE is not required to trigger tracking area
update procedure when the unavailability period duration has ended. If
the UE does not receive the Unavailability configuration IE, or the End
of unavailability report bit is set to "UE needs to report end of
unavailability", the UE should trigger tracking area update procedure
when the unavailability period duration has ended.

If the UE supports enhanced discontinuous coverage, the MME may include
the Discontinuous coverage maximum time offset IE in the TRACKING ARE
UPDATE ACCEPT message. If the UE receives, the Discontinuous coverage
maximum time offset IE in the TRACKING ARE UPDATE ACCEPT message, the UE
shall replace any previously received discontinuous coverage maximum
time offset value on the same satellite E-UTRAN access and PLMN with the
latest received timer value.

5.5.3.2.4A Tracking area updating successful for EPS services and not accepted for SMS services

Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter,
the description for tracking area update for EPS services as specified
in clause 5.5.3.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following
description for tracking area updating for SMS services applies.

In NB-S1 mode, if the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update
type IE and supports NB-S1 mode only, the MME decides to accept the
tracking area update request for EPS services only and:

- the location update for non-EPS services is not accepted by the VLR as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A]; or

- the MME decides to not accept the tracking area update request for
"SMS only",

the MME shall set the EPS update result IE to "EPS only", shall not
indicate "SMS only" in the Additional update result IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and shall include an appropriate SMS services
status value.

The UE receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message takes one of
the following actions depending on the value included in the SMS
services status IE:

"SMS services not available"

The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The USIM
shall be considered as invalid for SMS services until switching off or
the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as
described in clause 5.3.7a.

"SMS services not available in this PLMN"

The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

The UE may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that
the SMS services are not available.

The UE shall not attempt normal attach or tracking area updating
procedures indicating "SMS only" with current PLMN until switching off
the UE or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. Additionally, the UE
may perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

"Network failure"

The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set
to 5.

If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer
T3411 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS
services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer
T3402 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS
services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered.

"Congestion"

The UE shall stop the timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be set to 5. The UE shall start the timer
T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, and shall enter
state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer T3402 expires the normal
tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the
combined tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS
only" is triggered.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The tracking area
updating procedure shall be considered as failed for SMS services. The
behaviour of the UE in those cases is specified in clause 5.5.3.2.6A.

5.5.3.2.5 Normal and periodic tracking area updating procedure not accepted by the network

If the tracking area updating cannot be accepted by the network, the MME
sends a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message to the UE including an
appropriate EMM cause value.

If a tracking area update request from a UE with a LIPA PDN connection
is not accepted due to the reasons specified in clause 5.5.3.2.4, the
MME shall send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause
value #10 "Implicitly detached".

If the tracking area update request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the EMM
cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a value for back-off timer
T3346.

In NB-S1 mode, if the tracking area update request is rejected due to
operator determined barring (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [16C]), the network
shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a value for
back-off timer T3346.

If the tracking area request is rejected due to service gap control as
specified in clause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is running, the network
shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and may assign a
back-off timer T3346 with the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.

If the tracking area update request is rejected due to incompatibility
between the CIoT EPS optimizations supported by the UE and what the
network supports and the network sets the EMM cause value to #15 "no
suitable cells in tracking area", the network may additionally include
the Extended EMM cause IE with value "requested EPS optimization not
supported".

NOTE 1: How the UE uses the Extended EMM cause IE with value "requested
EPS optimization not supported" is implementation specific. The UE still
behaves according to the EMM cause value #15.

Based on operator policy, if the tracking area update request is
rejected due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations, the
network shall set the EMM cause value to #31 "Redirection to 5GCN
required".

NOTE 2: The network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability,
the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the 5GS CIoT
network behaviour supported by the 5GCN to determine the rejection with
the EMM cause value #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required".

If the UE initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, and the MME does not
support N26 interface, the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT
message with EMM cause value #9 "UE identity cannot be derived by the
network".

When the UE performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, if the
MME is informed that verification of the integrity protection of the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message has failed in the AMF, then:

a) If the MME can retrieve the current EPS security context as indicated
by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, the MME shall proceed as specified
in clause 5.5.3.2.4;

b) if the MME cannot retrieve the current EPS security context as
indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, or the eKSI or GUTI was
not sent by the UE, the MME may initiate the identification procedure by
sending the IDENTITY REQUEST message with the "Type of identity" of the
Identity type IE set to "IMSI" before taking actions as specified in
clause 4.4.4.3; or

c) If the MME needs to reject the tracking area updating procedure, the
MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause
value #9 "UE identity cannot be derived by the network".

In NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode via satellite E-UTRAN access, if the
tracking area updating request is from a UE via a satellite E-UTRA cell
and the network using the User Location Information provided by the
eNodeB (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]), is able to determine that the UE is in
a location where the network is not allowed to operate, the network
shall set the EMM cause value in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message
to #78 "PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location".

Upon receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message, if the message
is integrity protected or contains a reject cause other than EMM cause
value #25, the UE shall stop timer T3430 and stop any transmission of
user data.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 or #78 was
received without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the
message.

If the MME received multiple TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as
described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], and determines that, by UE
subscription and operator's preferences, all of the received TAIs are
forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service, the MME
shall include the TAI(s) in:

a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" IE;

b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service" IE; or

c) both,

in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message.

Regardless of the EMM cause value received in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REJECT message via satellite E-UTRAN,

- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming" IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT
message, the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE which are
belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s), if not already
stored, into the list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" and
ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent
PLMN(s); and

- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REJECT message, the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in
the IE which are belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s), if
not already stored, into the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service" and ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong
to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s)

Furthermore. the UE shall take the following actions depending on the
EMM cause value received in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message.

#3 (Illegal UE);

#6 (Illegal ME); or

#8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall consider
the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described
in clause 5.3.7a. The UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and
shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI. If the message has been
successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter
for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall
set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature,
RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number and the MM parameters update
status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence number as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the normal routing area updating
procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value. The USIM
shall be considered as invalid also for non-EPS services until switching
off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245
expires as described in clause 5.3.7a. If the message has been
successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter
for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then the UE
shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value.

For the EMM cause value #3 or #6, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM
parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
for the case when the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update performed over 3GPP access and indicating "mobility
registration updating" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the
same value.

For the EMM cause value #8, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to
5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, and
shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and
ngKSI.

NOTE 3: The possibility to configure a UE so that the radio transceiver
for a specific radio access technology is not active, although it is
implemented in the UE, is out of scope of the present specification.

#7 (EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall consider
the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described
in clause 5.3.7a. The UE shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If the
message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE
maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS services",
then the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum
value.

If the EPS update type is "periodic updating", a UE operating in CS/PS
mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation, which is IMSI attached for non-EPS
services, is still IMSI attached for non-EPS services. The UE operating
in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall set the update status
to U2 NOT UPDATED, shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology and shall proceed with appropriate MM specific procedure
according to the MM service state. The UE shall not reselect E‑UTRAN
radio access technology until switching off or the UICC containing the
USIM is removed.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature,
RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the normal routing area updating
procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status,
5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update performed over 3GPP access and
indicating "mobility registration updating" in the 5GS registration type
IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause
with the same value.

#9 (UE identity cannot be derived by the network);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED (and shall
store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI, last
visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services, the UE shall subsequently, automatically
initiate the attach procedure.

NOTE 4: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot
re-activate the EPS bearer(s) automatically.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature,
RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the normal routing area updating
procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same value.

If the UE is operating in the single-registration mode, the UE shall
handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last
visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the registration procedure for
mobility and periodic registration update performed over 3GPP access and
indicating "mobility registration updating" in the 5GS registration type
IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause
with the same value.

#10 (Implicitly detached);

If the EPS update type is "periodic updating", a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or
CS/PS mode 2 of operation is IMSI detached for both EPS services and
non-EPS services.

The UE shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE
shall delete any mapped EPS security context or partial native EPS
security context. If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall then perform a
new attach procedure.

NOTE 5: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot

message, the UE supports "E-UTRA Disabling for EMM cause #15", and the
"E-UTRA Disabling Allowed for EMM cause #15" parameter as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17] is present and set to
enabled; then the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability as specified in
clause 4.5 and search for a suitable cell in another location area or
5GS tracking area;

- if the UE is in NB-S1 mode and the Extended EMM cause IE with value
"NB-IoT not allowed" is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT
message, then the UE may disable the NB-IoT capability as specified in

same value.

#22 (Congestion);

If the T3346 value IE is present in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT
message and the value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor
deactivated, the UE shall proceed as described below, otherwise it shall
be considered as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE for this
case is specified in clause 5.5.3.2.6.

The UE shall abort the tracking area updating procedure, reset the
tracking area updating attempt counter and set the EPS update status to
EU2 NOT UPDATED. If the rejected request was not for initiating a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall change to state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

The UE shall stop timer T3346 if it is running.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is integrity protected, the
UE shall start timer with the value provided in the T3346 value IE.

registration updating" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the
same value.

#25 (Not authorized for this CSG);

EMM cause #25 is only applicable when received from a CSG cell. EMM
cause #25 received from a non-CSG cell is considered as an abnormal case
and the behaviour of the UE is specified in clause 5.5.3.2.6.

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
store it according to clause 5.1.3.3). The UE shall reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter and shall enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has
sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message are contained in the
Allowed CSG list, the UE shall remove the entry corresponding to this
CSG ID and associated PLMN identity from the Allowed CSG list.

If the CSG ID and associated PLMN identity of the cell where the UE has
sent the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message are contained in the
Operator CSG list, the UE shall apply the procedures defined in
3GPP TS 23.122 [6] clause 3.1A.

abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in
clause 5.5.3.2.6.

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3). The UE shall reset the
tracking area updating attempt counter and shall enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.LIMITED-SERVICE.

The UE shall enable N1 mode capability for 3GPP access if it was
disabled and disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, and
registration attempt counter as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the
case when the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update performed over 3GPP access and indicating "mobility
registration updating" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the
same value.

#36 (IAB-node operation not authorized);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to subclause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any
GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall reset
the tracking area updating attempt counter, delete the list of
equivalent PLMNs and enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH.

The UE shall store the PLMN identity in the "forbidden PLMN list" and if
the UE is configured to use timer T3245 (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) then the UE shall start timer T3245 and proceed as
described in subclause 5.3.7a. If the message has been successfully
integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a PLMN-specific
attempt counter for that PLMN, then the UE shall set this counter to the
UE implementation-specific maximum value.

The UE shall perform a PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status,

IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause
with the same value.

#40 (No EPS bearer context activated);

The UE shall deactivate all the EPS bearer contexts locally, if any, and
shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. If the rejected
request was not for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services, the UE shall perform a new attach procedure.

NOTE 7: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot
re-activate the EPS bearer(s) automatically.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
GMM state as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall
delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, eKSI, and list
of equivalent PLMNs, and set the tracking area update counter to 5. The
UE shall start an implementation specific timer, setting its value to 2
times the value of T as defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. While this timer
is running, the UE shall not consider the PLMN + RAT combination that
provided this reject cause as a candidate for PLMN selection. The UE
then enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a
PLMN selection according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The specification of the
UE behaviour in those cases is described in clause 5.5.3.2.6.

5.5.3.2.5A Tracking area updating procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services not accepted by the network

If the tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services cannot be accepted by the network, the UE
shall perform the procedures as described in clause 5.5.3.2.5. If the
tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services fails due to receiving the AUTHENTICATION
REJECT message, the UE shall perform the procedures as described in
clause 5.4.2.5. Then if the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the
last tracking area updating request was attempted, the UE shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

NOTE 1: This can result in the upper layers establishment of a CS
emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for
emergency bearer services.

If the tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services fails due to abnormal case a) in
clause 5.5.3.2.6, the UE shall perform the actions as described in
clause 5.5.3.2.6 and inform the upper layers of the failure to access
the network.

NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers establishment of a CS
emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

If the tracking area updating request for initiating a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services fails due to abnormal cases b), c), d) or
f) as well as k) when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, and ka) when
the "Extended wait time CP data" is ignored in clause 5.5.3.2.6, the UE
shall perform the procedures as described in clause 5.5.3.2.6. Then if
the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last tracking area
updating request was attempted, the UE shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

NOTE 3: This can result in the upper layers establishment of a CS
emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for
emergency bearer services.

5.5.3.2.5B Tracking area updating for access to RLOS not accepted by the network

If the tracking area updating request for access to RLOS cannot be
accepted by the network, the UE shall perform the procedures as
described in clause 5.5.3.2.5 along with the following conditions:

a) if the action for the reject involves searching for a suitable cell
in E-UTRAN radio access technology, the UE shall proceed with the action
and shall attempt to perform a tracking area updating procedure or an
attach procedure for access to RLOS in the new tracking area, if found,
depending on the EMM state.

b) if the action for the reject involves attempting to select GERAN or
UTRAN radio access technology or disabling the E-UTRAN capability, the
UE shall skip the action for as long as access to RLOS is still needed.

NOTE: How long the UE attempts to access RLOS is up to UE
implementation.

Then if

a) the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last tracking area
updating procedure was attempted and rejected;

b) the tracking area updating procedure was rejected with an EMM cause
value other than #9, #10 and #40; and

c) timer T3346 is not running,

the UE shall:

a) detach locally, if not detached already, perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] to attempt EPS attach for access to RLOS
via another PLMN.

If the tracking area updating request for access to RLOS fails due to
abnormal case a) in clause 5.5.3.2.6, the UE shall perform the actions
as described in clause 5.5.3.2.6 and inform the upper layers of the
failure to access the network.

If the tracking area updating request for access to RLOS fails due to
abnormal cases b), c) or d) in clause 5.5.3.2.6, the UE shall perform
the procedures as described in clause 5.5.3.2.6 with the exception that
the UE shall skip actions that involve attempting to select GERAN or
UTRAN radio access technology and actions that involve disabling of the
E-UTRA capability, for as long as access to RLOS is still needed. Then
if the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last tracking area
updating request was attempted, the UE shall:

a) detach locally, if not detached already, perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] to attempt EPS attach for access to RLOS
via another PLMN.

5.5.3.2.6 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Access barred because of access class barring, EAB, ACDC or NAS
signalling connection establishment rejected by the network without
"Extended wait time" received from lower layers

In WB-S1 mode, if the tracking area updating procedure is started in
response to a paging request from the network, access class barring, EAB
or ACDC is not applicable.

In NB-S1 mode, if the tracking area updating procedure is started in
response to a paging request from the network, access barring is not
applicable.

In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the tracking area updating procedure shall not be
started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal
cell reselection process. The tracking area updating procedure is
started as soon as possible and if still necessary, e.g. when access for
"originating signalling" is granted on the current cell or when the UE
moves to a cell where access for "originating signalling" is granted.

In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the tracking area updating procedure shall not be
started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal
cell reselection process. Further UE behaviour is implementation
specific, e.g. the tracking area updating procedure is started again
after an implementation dependent time.

In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating signalling" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), a request for an exceptional event is received
from the upper layers, then the tracking area updating procedure shall
be started.

NOTE 1: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring
alleviation indication from the lower layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

If access is barred because of access class barring for "originating
signalling" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) and if:

- one of the MO MMTEL voice call is started, MO MMTEL video call is
started or MO SMSoIP is started conditions is satisfied;

- the upper layers request to send a mobile originated SMS over NAS or
SMS over S102; or

- the upper layers request user plane radio resources, ACDC is
applicable to the request and the UE supports ACDC.

then the tracking area updating procedure shall be started according to
clause 5.5.3.2.2. The call type used shall be per annex D of this
document.

NOTE 2: If more than one of MO MMTEL voice call is started, MO MMTEL
video call is started or MO SMSoIP is started conditions are satisfied,
it is left to UE implementation to determine the call type based on
Annex D of this document.

If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and if the upper layers request user plane radio
resources for a higher ACDC category and the UE supports ACDC, then the
tracking area updating procedure shall be started according to
clause 5.5.3.2.2.

If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to
ACDC (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and if the upper layers request user
plane radio resources for a certain ACDC category and the UE supports
ACDC, then the tracking area updating procedure shall be started
according to clause 5.5.3.2.2.

If the trigger for the tracking area updating procedure is the response
to a paging request from the network and the NAS signalling connection
establishment is rejected by the network, the tracking area updating
procedure shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell
and applies normal cell reselection process. The tracking area updating
procedure may be started if it is still necessary when access for
"terminating calls" is granted or because of a cell change.

aa) Lower layer failure to establish the RRC connection and:

- the UE is in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is
present);

- the tracking area updating request is not for initiating a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services;

- the UE does not have a PDN connection for for emergency bearer
services;

- the UE supports being configured with CustomLLFailureRetry as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]); and

- CustomLLFailureRetry leaf is present as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]);

The UE shall increment the UE implementation specific attempt counter.
If the UE implementation specific attempt counter is less than the value
of MaxMinRetry, the UE shall start T3411 with the duration of
MinRetryTimer. If the UE implementation specific attempt counter is
equal to the value of MaxMinRetry, the UE shall start T3402 with the
duration of MaxRetryTimer.

The tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall
proceed as described below.

b) Lower layer failure not covered in case aa) or release of the NAS
signalling connection without "Extended wait time" and without "Extended
wait time CP data" received from lower layers before the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message is received

The tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted, and the UE shall
proceed as described below.

c) T3430 timeout

The UE shall abort the procedure. The NAS signalling connection, if any,
shall be released locally.

NOTE 3: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE
deems that the network has failed the authentication check as specified
in clause 5.4.2.7.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

d) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT, other causes than those treated in
clause 5.5.3.2.5, and cases of EMM cause values #22, #25, #31 and #78,
if considered as abnormal cases according to clause 5.5.3.2.5

If the tracking area updating request is not for initiating a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services, upon reception of the EMM
causes #95, #96, #97, #99 and #111 the UE should set the tracking area
updating attempt counter to 5.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

e) Change of cell into a new tracking area

If a cell change into a new tracking area occurs before the tracking
area updating procedure is completed, the tracking area updating
procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. The UE shall
set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

f) Tracking area updating and detach procedure collision

EPS detach containing detach type "re-attach required" or "re-attach not
required":

If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the tracking area
updating procedure has been completed, the tracking area updating
procedure shall be aborted and the detach procedure shall be progressed.
If the DETACH REQUEST message contains detach type "re-attach not
required" and EMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in HSS", the UE will follow the
procedure as described below for the detach type "IMSI detach".

EPS detach containing detach type "IMSI detach":

If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message before the tracking area
updating procedure has been completed, the DETACH REQUEST message shall
be ignored and tracking area updating procedure shall be progressed.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

g) Tracking area updating and GUTI reallocation procedure collision

If the UE receives a GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message before the
tracking area updating procedure has been completed, this message shall
be ignored and the tracking area updating procedure shall be progressed.

h) Transmission failure of TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message
indication from lower layers

The tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated
immediately. The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED.

i) Transmission failure of TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message
indication with TAI change from lower layers

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the tracking area updating
procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated immediately. The UE shall
set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE
implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure.

j) Transmission failure of TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message
indication without TAI change from lower layers

It is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure.

k) "Extended wait time" from the lower layers

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message contained the low priority
indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", the
UE shall start timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value and reset
the tracking area updating attempt counter.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message did not contain the low
priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
priority", the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and the UE is not a UE
configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE shall start
timer T3346 with the "Extended wait time" value and reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter.

In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

The UE shall abort the tracking area updating procedure, stay in the
current serving cell, set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED,
change the state to EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE and apply the
normal cell reselection process.

If the UE had used eDRX before initiating tracking area updating
procedure, then the UE shall continue to use the eDRX with the extended
DRX parameters IE received during the last attach or tracking area
updating procedure.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

ka) "Extended wait time CP data" from the lower layers

If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and supports the timer T3448, the
UE shall start the timer T3448 with the "Extended wait time CP data"
value. If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and does not support the
timer T3448, the UE shall start the timer T3346 with the "Extended wait
time CP data" value and reset the tracking area updating attempt
counter.

In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time CP data".

The UE shall abort the tracking area updating procedure, stay in the
current serving cell, set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED,
change the state to EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE and apply the
normal cell reselection process.

If the UE had used eDRX before initiating tracking area updating
procedure, then the UE shall continue to use the eDRX with the extended
DRX parameters IE received during the last attach or tracking area
updating procedure.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

l) Timer T3346 is running

The UE shall not start the tracking area updating procedure unless:

- the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode;

- the UE received a paging;

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established
or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

- the UE is requested by the upper layer for a CS fallback for emergency
call or a 1xCS fallback for emergency call;

- the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user
data related to an exceptional event and

i) the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the
ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EF_(NASCONFIG) in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]); and

ii) timer T3346 was not started when NAS signalling connection was
established with RRC establishment cause set to "MO exception data";

- the UE has a PDN connection established without the NAS signalling low
priority indication or is establishing a PDN connection without the NAS
signalling low priority indication, the timer T3402 and the timer T3411
are not running and the timer T3346 was started due to rejection of a
NAS request message (e.g. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST) which contained the low priority indicator
set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority"; or

- the MUSIM UE needs to request an IMSI offset value as specified in
clause 5.5.3.2.2.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process.

NOTE 4: It is considered an abnormal case if the UE needs to initiate a
tracking area updating procedure while timer T3346 is running
independent on whether timer T3346 was started due to an abnormal case
or a non successful case.

If the TAI of the current serving cell is not included in the TAI list
or the TIN indicates "P-TMSI", the UE shall set the EPS update status to
EU2 NOT UPDATED and change to state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

If the tracking area updating procedure needs to be initiated for an MO
MMTEL voice call or an MO MMTEL video call is started, then a
notification that the procedure was not initiated due to network
congestion shall be provided to upper layers.

NOTE 5: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
the originating voice call on an alternative manner e.g. requesting
establishment of a CS voice call (see 3GPP TS 24.173 [13E]).

The UE shall proceed as described below.

la) Timer T3448 is running

The UE shall not start the tracking area updating procedure with the
"signalling active" flag set, unless:

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE which is only using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization received a paging; or

- the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user
data related to an exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use
exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of
the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file
EF_(NASCONFIG) in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process.

The UE shall proceed as described below.

m) Mobile originated detach required

Detach due to removal of USIM or due to switch off:

The tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted, and the UE
initiated detach procedure shall be performed.

Detach not due to removal of USIM and not due to switch off:

The UE initiated detach procedure shall be initiated after successful
completion of the tracking area updating procedure.

o) Timer T3447 is running

The UE shall not start the tracking area updating procedure with the
"signalling active" flag set or the "active" flag set, unless:

- the UE received a paging;

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established
or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or

- the MUSIM UE needs to request an IMSI offset value as specified in
clause 5.5.3.2.2.

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The tracking area update request procedure is
started, if still necessary, when timer T3447 expires.

p) Tracking area updating and paging procedure collision

If the UE receives a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message before the tracking
area updating procedure has been completed, the UE shall progress the
tracking area updating procedure and respond to the CS SERVICE
NOTIFICATION upon successful completion of the tracking area updating
procedure.

For the cases aa, b, c, d, e, f with detach type "re-attach required" or
"re-attach not required" with EMM cause other than #2 "IMSI unknown in
HSS", k and ka, the UE shall stop any ongoing transmission of user data.

For the cases aa, b, c, d, k, ka, l and la, the UE shall proceed as
follows:

1) Timer T3430 shall be stopped if still running.

2) For the cases aa, b, c, d, la k when the "Extended wait time" is
ignored, and ka when the "Extended wait time CP data" is ignored, if the
tracking area updating request is not for initiating a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services, the tracking area updating attempt
counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set to 5.

3) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5, the TAI
of the current serving cell is included in the TAI list, the EPS update
status is equal to EU1 UPDATED, the TIN does not indicate "P-TMSI" and
the tracking area updating procedure is performed not due to an
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode and the tracking area
updating procedure is not performed due to cases g, m, n, za, zc in
clause 5.5.3.2.2:

- the UE shall keep the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The UE shall start timer T3411.

- If in addition the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST indicated "periodic
updating" or if tracking area updating procedure was initiated to
recover NAS signalling connection due to "RRC Connection failure" from
the lower layers, none of the other reasons for initiating the tracking
area updating procedure listed in clause 5.5.3.2.2 was applicable, and
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message did not include T3324 value IE,
T3412 extended value IE or Extended DRX parameters IE, the timer T3411
may be stopped when the UE enters EMM-CONNECTED mode.

- If timer T3411 expires the tracking area updating procedure is
triggered again.

4) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5, and the
TAI of the current serving cell is not included in the TAI list or the
EPS update status is different to EU1 UPDATED or the TIN indicates
"P-TMSI" or the tracking area updating procedure is performed due to an
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode or if the tracking area
updating procedure is performed due to cases g, m, n, za, zc in clause
5.5.3.2.2:

- for the cases k and l, the tracking area updating procedure is
started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

- for the case ka, if timer T3346 is started, the tracking area updating
procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is
stopped.

- for the case ka, if timer T3448 is started and the "signalling active"
flag is set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the tracking
area updating procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3448
expires or is stopped.

- for the case la, if the "signalling active" flag is set in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the tracking area updating
procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3448 expires or is
stopped.

- for the cases aa, b, c, d, k when the "Extended wait time" is ignored,
and ka when the "Extended wait time CP data" is ignored, if the tracking
area updating request is not for initiating a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services, the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the
EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and change to state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE. When timer T3411 expires the
tracking area updating procedure is triggered again.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the GPRS update status as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for
the abnormal case when a normal or periodic routing area updating
procedure fails and the routing area updating attempt counter is less
than 5 and the GPRS update status is different from GU1 UPDATED.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GS update status as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the abnormal cases when a registration procedure
for mobility and periodic registration fails and the registration
attempt counter is less than 5 and the 5GS update status is different
from 5U1 UPDATED.

5) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3402 if the value of the timer as indicated
by the network is not zero, shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT
UPDATED;

- if the value of T3402 as indicated by the network is zero, the UE
shall perform the actions defined for the expiry of the timer T3402;

- the UE shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and shall change to
state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE or optionally to
EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6]; and

- if A/Gb mode, Iu mode or N1 mode is supported by the UE:

- if A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in
addition handle the GPRS update status as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the abnormal case when a normal or periodic
routing area updating procedure fails and the routing area updating
attempt counter is equal to 5;

- if the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GS update status as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the abnormal case when a registration procedure
for mobility or periodic registration update performed over 3GPP access
fails and the registration attempt counter is equal to 5; and

- if the UE does not change to state EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, the UE
shall

- except for case aa attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio
access technology. For case aa the UE may attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN
or NG-RAN radio access technology and proceed with appropriate GMM or
5GMM specific procedures. Additionally, if the UE selects GERAN or UTRAN
radio access technology, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as
specified in clause 4.5. If No E-UTRA Disabling In 5GS is enabled at the
UE (see 3GPP TS 24.368 [50] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and the UE selects
NG-RAN radio access technology, it shall not disable the E-UTRA
capability; otherwise, the UE may disable the E-UTRA capability as
specified in clause 4.5.

NOTE 6: Whether the UE requests RRC to treat the active E-UTRA cell as
barred (see 3GPP TS 36.304 [21]) is left to the UE implementation.

If a GERAN or UTRAN cell is selected:

- a UE in PS mode 1 or PS mode 2 of operation shall proceed with
appropriate GMM specific procedures;

- a UE in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation shall proceed with
appropriate MM or GMM specific procedures.

If an NG-RAN cell is selected, the UE shall proceed with appropriate
5GMM specific procedures.

5.5.3.2.6A Abnormal cases in the UE, SMS services not accepted

The UE shall proceed as follows:

1) if the tracking area update was successful for EPS services only and
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contained a value included in
the SMS services status IE not treated in clause 5.5.3.2.4A, the UE
shall proceed as follows:

a) The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be incremented, unless it was already set
to 5;

b) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer
T3411 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS
services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered;

c) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. When timer
T3402 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS
services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure
for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered; and

2) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in clause 5.5.3.2.6 apply.

5.5.3.2.7 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) If a lower layer failure occurs before the message TRACKING AREA
UPDATE COMPLETE has been received from the UE and a GUTI has been
assigned, the network shall abort the procedure, enter EMM-IDLE mode and
shall consider both, the old and new GUTI as valid until the old GUTI
can be considered as invalid by the network (see clause 5.4.1.4). During
this period the network may use the identification procedure followed by
a GUTI reallocation procedure if the old GUTI is used by the UE in a
subsequent message.

The network may page with IMSI if paging with old and new S-TMSI fails.
Paging with IMSI causes the UE to re-attach as described in
clause 5.6.2.2.2.

Additionally, if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes:

1) a different negotiated IMSI offset value assigned to a UE that
previously had another negotiated IMSI offset value assigned;

2) no negotiated IMSI offset value assigned to a UE that previously had
negotiated IMSI offset value assigned; or

3) a negotiated IMSI offset value assigned to a UE that previously had
no negotiated IMSI offset value assigned;

for case 1) the network shall use two alternative IMSI values and for
case 2) and 3) the network shall use one alternative IMSI value and the
IMSI value for paging the UE until one of the two (alternative) IMSI
values can be considered as invalid by the network.

NOTE 1: As the network assigns a new GUTI when the alternative IMSI
value is changed or deleted (see clause 5.5.3.2.4), the network can
consider the alternative IMSI value associated with the old GUTI as
invalid if the UE responds to the paging with the new GUTI.

If the UE supports WUS assistance, the MME supports and accepts the use
of WUS assistance and if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
includes:

1) a different negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE
assigned to a UE that previously had another negotiated UE paging
probability information for the UE assigned;

2) no negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE assigned
to a UE that previously had negotiated UE paging probability information
for the UE assigned; or

3) a negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE assigned to
a UE that previously had no negotiated UE paging probability information
for the UE assigned;

for case 1) the network shall use two UE paging probability information
for the UE values and for case 2) and 3) the network shall use one UE
paging probability information for the UE value for paging the UE until
one of the two UE paging probability information for the UE values can
be considered as invalid by the network.

NOTE 2: As the network assigns a new GUTI when the UE paging probability
information for the UE value is changed or deleted (see clause
5.5.3.2.4), the network can consider the UE paging probability
information for the UE value associated with the old GUTI as invalid if
the UE responds to the paging with the new GUTI.

b) Protocol error

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message has been received with a
protocol error, the network shall return a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT
message with one of the following EMM cause values:

#96: invalid mandatory information element error;

#99: information element non-existent or not implemented;

#100: conditional IE error; or

#111: protocol error, unspecified.

c) T3450 time-out

On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and shall reset and restart timer
T3450. The retransmission is performed four times, i.e. on the fifth
expiry of timer T3450, the tracking area updating procedure is aborted.
Both, the old and the new GUTI shall be considered as valid until the
old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network (see
clause 5.4.1.4). During this period the network acts as described for
case a above.

d) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST received after the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message has been sent and before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
COMPLETE message is received

If one or more of the information elements in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message differ from the ones received within the previous
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the previously initiated tracking
area updating procedure shall be aborted if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
COMPLETE message has not been received and the new tracking area
updating procedure shall be progressed; or

If the information elements do not differ for cases other than
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode with the UE
operating in the single-registration mode, then the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message shall be resent and the timer T3450 shall be restarted if
a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is expected. If the information
elements do not differ for the case of inter-system change from N1 mode
to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode with the UE operating in the
single-registration mode, the MME should forward the new TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message which contains the same information elements as
the previous TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the source AMF to
run the integrity check, obtain the latest mapped EPS security context
(to be used to protect any future NAS message sent to the UE) and
continue with the new tracking area updating procedure. In these cases,
the retransmission counter related to T3450 is not incremented.

NOTE 3: Instead of forwarding the new TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message which contains the same information elements to the source AMF,
the MME can decide to initiate an authentication procedure followed by a
security mode control procedure to take the new partial native EPS
security context into use if the new partial native EPS security context
is taken into use successfully, then resend the same TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message protected using this new EPS security context.

e) More than one TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST received and no TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message has been sent

If one or more of the information elements in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message differs from the ones received within the previous
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the previously initiated tracking
area updating procedure shall be aborted and the new tracking area
updating procedure shall be progressed;

if the information elements do not differ for cases other than
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode with the UE
operating in the single-registration mode, then the network shall
continue with the previous tracking area updating procedure and shall
not treat any further this TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message. If the
information elements do not differ for the case of inter-system change
from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode with the UE operating in the
single-registration mode, the MME should forward the new TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message which contains the same information elements as
the previous TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the source AMF to
run the integrity check, obtain the latest mapped EPS security context
(to be used to protect any future NAS message sent to the UE) and
continue with the previous tracking area updating procedure.

NOTE 4: Instead of forwarding the new TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message which contains the same information elements to the source AMF,
the MME can decide to initiate an authentication procedure followed by a
security mode control procedure to take the new partial native EPS
security context into use and, if the new partial native EPS security
context is taken into use successfully, use this new EPS security
context to protect any future NAS message sent to the UE.

f) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REJECT message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and
the TAI of the target cell and the TAI of the source cell are the same,
then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall
retransmit the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REJECT message. If a failure of the handover procedure is
reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the
MME shall retransmit the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REJECT message.

g) DETACH REQUEST message received before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message is sent or before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE
message (in case of GUTI and/or TMSI was allocated) is received.

Detach containing cause "switch off":

The network shall abort the signalling for the tracking area updating
procedure towards the UE and shall progress the detach procedure as
described in clause 5.5.2.2.

NOTE 5: Internally in the network, before processing the detach request,
the MME can perform the necessary signalling procedures for the tracking
area updating procedure before progressing the detach procedure.

Detach containing other causes than "switch off":

The network shall proceed with the tracking area updating procedure and
shall progress the detach procedure after successful completion of the
tracking area updating procedure.

h) If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with EPS update type IE
indicating "periodic updating" is received by the new MME which does not
have the EMM context data related to the subscription, the new MME may
send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause value #10
"Implicitly detached"

5.5.3.3 Combined tracking area updating procedure

5.5.3.3.1 General

Within a combined tracking area updating procedure the messages TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT and TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE carry information
for the tracking area updating and the location area updating.

The combined tracking area updating procedure follows the normal
tracking area updating procedure described in clause 5.5.3.2 with
exception of clause 5.5.3.2.4A and clause 5.5.3.2.6A.

5.5.3.3.2 Combined tracking area updating procedure initiation

The UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2, in state
EMM-REGISTERED, shall initiate the combined tracking area updating
procedure:

a) when the UE that is attached for both EPS and non-EPS services
detects that the current TAI is not in the list of tracking areas that

to "P-TMSI" before initiating the combined tracking area updating
procedure.

For cases n, zc, ze and zh the UE shall include a UE radio capability
information update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message.

NOTE 3a: For cases n, zc, ze and zh if the UE supports RACS irrespective
whether the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE
radio configuration in the selected PLMN the UE radio capability
information update needed IE is included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message.

If the UE is in the EMM-CONNECTED mode and the UE changes the radio
capability for E-UTRAN or for NG-RAN, the UE may locally release the
established NAS signalling connection and enter the EMM-IDLE mode. Then,
the UE shall initiate the combined tracking area updating procedure
including a UE radio capability information update needed IE in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

For case l, if the TIN indicates "RAT-related TMSI", the UE shall set
the TIN to "P-TMSI" before initiating the combined tracking area
updating procedure.

For case r, the "active" flag in the EPS update type IE shall be set
to 1. If the paging is received for CS fallback, the UE shall send the
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message to the MME by using the existing NAS
signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating
procedure. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes a UE
radio capability ID deletion indication IE set to "Network-assigned UE
radio capability IDs deletion requested", the UE shall proceed with
sending the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message. To initiate a combined
tracking area updating procedure the UE sends the message TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST to the network, starts timer T3430 and changes to state
EMM-TRACKING-AREA-UPDATING-INITIATED. The value of the EPS update type
IE in the message shall indicate "combined TA/LA updating" unless
explicitly specified otherwise.

If the UE initiates the combined tracking area updating procedure for
EPS services and "SMS only", the UE shall indicate "SMS only" in the
additional update type IE.

inter-system mobility from WB-S1 mode to NB-S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode;

2) locally deactivated at least one dedicated EPS bearer context upon an
inter-system change from WB-N1 mode to NB-S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode for
the UE operating in single-registration mode (see clause 6.4.2.1); or

3) locally deactivated at least one default EPS bearer context upon an
inter-system change from N1 mode to NB-S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode for the
UE operating in single-registration mode (see clause 6.5.0).

In WB-S1 mode, if the UE supports RACS the UE shall set the RACS bit to
"RACS supported" in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message.

For cases n, zc, ze and zh, in WB-S1 mode, if the UE supports RACS and
the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE radio
configuration in the selected PLMN, the UE shall set the URCIDA bit to
"UE radio capability ID available" in the UE radio capability ID
availability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

For all cases except cases n, zc, ze and zh, in WB-S1 mode, if the UE
has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio
configuration in the selected PLMN, the UE shall set the URCIDA bit to
"UE radio capability ID available" in the UE radio capability ID
availability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

5.5.3.3.3 EMM common procedure initiation

During the combined tracking area updating procedure, the MME may
initiate EMM common procedures, e.g. the EMM authentication and security
mode control procedures. For restrictions applicable after handover or
inter-system handover to S1 mode see clause 5.5.3.2.3.

5.5.3.3.4 Combined tracking area updating procedure accepted by the network

5.5.3.3.4.1 General

Depending on the value of the EPS update result IE received in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the following different cases can
be distinguished:

1) The EPS update result IE value indicates "combined TA/LA updated":
Tracking and location area updating is successful for EPS and non-EPS
services, or for EPS services and "SMS only";

2) The EPS update result IE value indicates "TA updated": Tracking area
updating is successful, but location area updating for non-EPS services
or "SMS only" is not successful.

A TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message shall be returned to the network
if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a GUTI or a TMSI or
both.

5.5.3.3.4.2 Combined tracking area updating successful

The description for normal tracking area update as specified in
clause 5.5.3.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following
description for location area updating applies.

The TMSI reallocation may be part of the combined tracking area updating
procedure. The TMSI allocated is then included in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message together with the location area identification
(LAI). In this case the MME shall change to state
EMM-COMMON-PROCEDURE-INITIATED and shall start the timer T3450 as
described in clause 5.4.1. The LAI may be included in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message without TMSI. If the MME does not indicate "SMS
only" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, subject to operator
policies the MME should allocate a TAI list that does not span more than
one location area.

For a shared network in CS domain, the MME indicates the selected PLMN
for CS domain in the LAI to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 [9].

The UE, receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, stores the
received location area identification, resets the location update
attempt counter, sets the update status to U1 UPDATED and enters MM
state MM IDLE.

If the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for
non-GPRS services" events (see clause 5.3.7b), then the UE shall reset
this counter.

If the LAI contained in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is a
member of the list of "forbidden location areas for regional provision
of service" or the list of "forbidden location areas for roaming" then
such entry shall be deleted.

If the PLMN identity for the CS domain which is provided as part of the
LAI contained in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message differs from
the PLMN identity provided as part of the GUTI, the MME shall include
the PLMN identity for the CS domain in the list of equivalent PLMNs in
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

If the UE requested "SMS only" in the Additional update type IE, or if
the UE requested a combined tracking area updating for EPS and non-EPS
services, but the network decides to accept the tracking area update
request for EPS services and "SMS only", the network shall indicate "SMS
only" in the Additional update result IE. In addition, if the SMS
services are provided via SMS in MME, the network shall, in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, provide a non-broadcast LAI and may indicate
in the EPS update result IE that ISR is activated. If a TMSI has to be
allocated, then the network shall also provide a TMSI which cannot cause
any ambiguity with assigned TMSI values.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes the Additional
update result IE with value "SMS only", a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2
and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice available" shall not
attempt to use CS fallback for mobile originating services.

As an implementation option, if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
does not include the Additional update result IE with value "SMS only"
and the UE is not configured for NAS signalling low priority then the UE
may stop timer T3246 if running.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes the Additional
update result IE with value "CS Fallback not preferred", this indicates
to a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1
with "IMS voice available" that it is attached for EPS and non-EPS
services and that it can use CS fallback.

How to handle the old TMSI stored in the UE depends on the mobile
identity included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.

- If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an IMSI, the UE is
not allocated any TMSI, and shall delete any old TMSI accordingly.

- If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains a TMSI, the UE
shall use this TMSI as new temporary identity. The UE shall delete its
old TMSI and shall store the new TMSI. In this case, a TRACKING AREA
UPDATE COMPLETE message is returned to the network to confirm the
received TMSI.

- If neither a TMSI nor an IMSI has been included by the network in the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the old TMSI, if any is available,
shall be kept.

NOTE 1: It is possible for UEs compliant with earlier versions of this
specification to send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message even if
TMSI reallocation is not part of the combined tracking area updating
procedure.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes the Additional
update result IE with value "SMS only" or "CS Fallback not preferred", a
UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 with "IMS voice not available" shall
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and disable the
E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

The network receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message stops
timer T3450, changes to state EMM-REGISTERED.

NOTE 2: Upon receiving a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message, if a new
TMSI was included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, the MME
sends an SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message as specified in
3GPP TS 29.118 [16A].

Unless the MME supporting N26 is in a deployment where it, after
intersystem change from N1 mode to S1 mode, has an IMEI or an IMEISV for
the UE, then after the UE performs intersystem change from N1 mode to S1
mode, if:

- the network supports SRVCC for IMS emergency sessions (see
3GPP TS 23.216 [8]);

- the UE has an emergency PDN connection;

- the UE has set the SRVCC to GERAN/UTRAN capability bit in the MS
network capability IE to "SRVCC from UTRAN HSPA or E-UTRAN to
GERAN/UTRAN supported; and

- the MME has neither an IMEI nor an IMEISV for the UE;

NOTE 3: The AMF can receive an IMEI from the UE and pass it to the MME
during the intersystem change if the UE is emergency registered and the
UE doesn't have a valid USIM or the UE's IMSI remains unauthenticated.

then the MME shall initiate the identification procedure (see
clause 5.4.4) or the security mode control procedure (see clause 5.4.3)
with the UE.

5.5.3.3.4.3 Combined tracking area updating successful for EPS services only

Apart from the actions on the tracking area updating attempt counter,
the description for tracking area for EPS services as specified in
clause 5.5.3.2.4 shall be followed. In addition, the following
description for location updating for non-EPS services applies.

If, due to emergency services fallback (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [59],
clause 4.13.4), there is a request for emergency services pending and
the emergency bearer services indicator in the EPS network feature
support IE indicates "emergency bearer services in S1 mode not
supported", then the UE shall skip the requirements defined below in the
present clause for the receipt of a TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
including an EMM cause value, attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio
access technology, select a setup message as defined in clause 5.3.7,
proceed with appropriate MM specific procedures, and send the setup
message.

The UE receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message takes one of
the following actions depending on the EMM cause value:

#2 (IMSI unknown in HSS)

The UE shall stop T3430 if still running and shall reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter. The UE shall set the update status to U3
ROAMING NOT ALLOWED and shall delete any TMSI, LAI and ciphering key
sequence number. The UE shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.
The new MM state is MM IDLE. The USIM shall be considered as invalid for
non-EPS services until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is
removed or the timer T3245 expires as described clause 5.3.7a. If the UE
maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS
services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE
implementation-specific maximum value.

If, due to emergency services fallback (see 3GPP TS 23.502 [59]), there
is a request for CS fallback call pending (see clause 5.3.7), the UE
shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and
attempt emergency call setup.

A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not
available" and without a persistent EPS bearer context shall disable the
E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

A UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not
available" and with a persistent EPS bearer context shall, after the
radio bearer associated with the persistent EPS bearer context has been
released, disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

#16 (MSC temporarily not reachable); or

#17 (Network failure)

The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, and shall enter state MM
IDLE. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be incremented,
unless it was already set to 5.

If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM.
When timer T3411 expires the combined tracking area updating procedure
indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered
again.

If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in
CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice available" shall start timer
T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter
state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3402 expires
the combined tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA
updating with IMSI attach" is triggered again;

- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not
available" without a persistent EPS bearer context shall attempt to
select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and proceed with
appropriate MM or GMM specific procedures and disable the E-UTRA
capability (see clause 4.5);

- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not
available" and with a persistent EPS bearer context shall start timer
T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter
state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM. When timer T3402 expires
the combined tracking area updating procedure indicating "combined TA/LA
updating with IMSI attach" is triggered again. When the radio bearer
associated with the persistent EPS bearer context has been released and
the UE is registered for EPS services only, operating in CS/PS mode 1 of
operation with "IMS voice not available", then the UE shall stop timer
T3402, if already running, attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology and proceed with appropriate MM or GMM specific procedures
and disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

#18 (CS domain not available)

The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, shall reset the tracking
area updating attempt counter, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

The UE shall enter state MM IDLE and shall set the update status to U2
NOT UPDATED.

A UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" without
a persistent EPS bearer context shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN
radio access technology rather than E-UTRAN for the registered PLMN or
equivalent PLMN and disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

A UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not available" and
with a persistent EPS bearer context shall, after the radio bearer
associated with the persistent EPS bearer context has been released,
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology rather than
E-UTRAN for the registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN and disable the
E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5).

A UE in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of
operation with "IMS voice available" may provide a notification to the
user or the upper layers that the CS domain is not available.

The UE shall not attempt combined attach or combined tracking area
updating procedure with current PLMN until switching off the UE or the
UICC containing the USIM is removed.

#22 (Congestion)

The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running. The tracking area
updating attempt counter shall be set to 5. The UE shall start timer
T3402, shall set the EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED, shall enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM, shall enter state MM IDLE.

Other EMM cause values and the case that no EMM cause IE was received
are considered as abnormal cases. The combined tracking area updating
procedure shall be considered as failed for non-EPS services. The
behaviour of the UE in those cases is specified in clause 5.5.3.3.6.

5.5.3.3.5 Combined tracking area updating procedure not accepted by the network

If the combined tracking area updating cannot be accepted by the
network, the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message to the
UE including an appropriate EMM cause value.

If the MME locally deactivates EPS bearer contexts for the UE (see
clause 5.5.3.2.4) and no active EPS bearer contexts remain for the UE,
the MME shall send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message including the
EMM cause value #10 "implicitly detached".

If the tracking area update request is rejected due to general NAS level
mobility management congestion control, the network shall set the EMM
cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a back-off timer T3346.

If the UE initiated the tracking area updating procedure due to
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, and the MME does not
support N26 interface, the MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT
message with EMM cause value #9 "UE identity cannot be derived by the
network".

When the UE performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, if the
MME is informed that verification of the integrity protection of the
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message has failed in the AMF, then:

a) If the MME can retrieve the current EPS security context as indicated
by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, the MME shall proceed as specified
in clause 5.5.3.2.4;

b) if the MME cannot retrieve the current EPS security context as
indicated by the eKSI and GUTI sent by the UE, or the eKSI or GUTI was
not sent by the UE, the MME may initiate the identification procedure by
sending the IDENTITY REQUEST message with the "Type of identity" of the
Identity type IE set to "IMSI" before taking actions as specified in
clause 4.4.4.3; or

c) If the MME needs to reject the tracking area updating procedure, the
MME shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause
value #9 "UE identity cannot be derived by the network".

If the tracking area request is rejected due to service gap control as
specified in clause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer is running, the network
shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and may assign a
back-off timer T3346 with the remaining time of the running T3447 timer.

Based on operator policy, if the tracking area update request is
rejected due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations, the
network shall set the EMM cause value to #31 "Redirection to 5GCN
required".

NOTE 1: The network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability,
the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the 5GS CIoT
network behaviour supported by the 5GCN to determine the rejection with
the EMM cause value #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required".

Upon receiving the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message, if the message
is integrity protected or contains a reject cause other than EMM cause
value #25, the UE shall stop timer T3430, stop any transmission of user
data and enter state MM IDLE.

If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 or #78 was
received without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the
message.

The UE shall take the following actions depending on the EMM cause value
received in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message.

#3 (Illegal UE);

#6 (Illegal ME); or

#8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI List and eKSI.

The UE shall consider the USIM as invalid for EPS and non-EPS services
until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed or the
timer T3245 expires as described in clause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the UE
shall delete the list of equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI. If the message has been successfully integrity
checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM
considered invalid for GPRS services", then the UE shall set this
counter to UE implementation-specific maximum value. If the message has
been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the UE maintains a
counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for non-GPRS services", then
the UE shall set this counter to UE implementation-specific maximum
value.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
MM parameters update status, TMSI, LAI and ciphering key sequence
number, and the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI,
P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when the combined routing
area updating procedure is rejected with the GMM cause with the same
value.

For the EMM cause value #3 or #6, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM
parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited
registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
for the case when the registration procedure for mobility and periodic
registration update performed over 3GPP access and indicating "mobility
registration updating" in the 5GS registration type IE of the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message is rejected with the 5GMM cause with the
same value.

For the EMM cause value #8, if the UE is operating in
single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition set the 5GMM state to
5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, and
shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and
ngKSI.#7 (EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,

procedures; otherwise, if there is a CS fallback emergency call or CS
fallback call pending, the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the
EMM procedure to the MM sublayer.

If there is a 1xCS fallback emergency call pending or 1xCS fallback call
pending, or a paging for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall select cdma2000® 1x
radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate
cdma2000^(®) 1x CS procedures.

If there is a 1xCS fallback emergency call pending or 1xCS fallback call
pending, or a paging for 1xCS fallback, and the UE has dual Rx/Tx
configuration and supports enhanced 1xCS fallback, the UE shall perform
a new attach procedure.

If there is no CS fallback emergency call pending, CS fallback call
pending, 1xCS fallback emergency call pending, 1xCS fallback call
pending, paging for CS fallback, or paging for 1xCS fallback and the
rejected fallback request was not for initiating a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services, the UE shall perform a new attach procedure.

NOTE 5: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot
re-activate the EPS bearer(s) automatically.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the GMM state as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case
when the combined routing area updating procedure is rejected with the

The UE shall proceed as follows:

1) if the UE requested the combined tracking area update for EPS
services and "SMS only" and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
indicates a combined tracking area updating procedure successful for EPS
and non-EPS services, the UE shall behave as if the combined tracking
area updating procedure was successful for EPS services and "SMS only";

NOTE: In this case the UE can ignore the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message
or the Paging with CN domain indicator set to "CS", as specified in
clause 5.6.2.3.2.

2) if the combined tracking area update was successful for EPS services
only and the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contained an EMM cause
value not treated in clause 5.5.3.3.4.3 or the EMM Cause IE is not
included in the message, the UE shall proceed as follows:

a) The UE shall stop timer T3430 if still running, and shall enter state
MM IDLE. The tracking area updating attempt counter shall be
incremented, unless it was already set to 5;

b) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5:

- the UE shall start timer T3411, shall set the EPS update status to EU1
UPDATED and shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM.
When timer T3411 expires the combined tracking area updating procedure
indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered
again;

c) If the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5:

- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 2 of operation and a UE operating in
CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice available" shall start timer
T3402 if the value indicated by the network is not zero, shall set the
EPS update status to EU1 UPDATED and shall enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE-MM.

- If the value of T3402 as indicated by the network is zero, the UE
shall perform the actions defined for the expiry of the timer T3402.

- When timer T3402 expires the combined tracking area updating procedure
indicating "combined TA/LA updating with IMSI attach" is triggered
again; and

- a UE operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation with "IMS voice not
available" shall attempt to select GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN radio access
technology, proceed with appropriate MM, GMM or 5GMM specific procedures
and disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause 4.5); and

d) If there is a CS fallback emergency call or CS fallback call pending,
or a paging for CS fallback, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or
UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN
cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific
procedures; otherwise, if there is a CS fallback emergency call or CS
fallback call pending, the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the
EMM procedure to the MM sublayer; and

3) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in clause 5.5.3.2.6 apply
with the following modification.

If the tracking area updating attempt counter is incremented according
to clause 5.5.3.2.6 the next actions depend on the value of the tracking
area updating attempt counter.

- If the tracking area updating attempt counter is less than 5, the UE
shall set the update status to U2 NOT UPDATED, but shall not delete any
LAI, TMSI, ciphering key sequence number and list of equivalent PLMNs
and additionally if the tracking area updating procedure was performed
due to cases h, m, n, z, zc in clause 5.5.3.3.2 the update status shall
be changed to EU2; or

- if the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5, the UE
shall delete any LAI, TMSI and ciphering key sequence number and set the
update status to U2 NOT UPDATED.

If there is a CS fallback emergency call pending or CS fallback call
pending, or a paging for CS fallback, the UE shall attempt to select
GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN
or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific
procedures; otherwise if there is a CS fallback emergency call or CS
fallback call pending, the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the
EMM procedure to the MM sublayer.

5.5.3.3.7 Abnormal cases on the network side

The abnormal cases specified in clause 5.5.3.2.7 apply.

5.5.4 eCall inactivity procedure

The eCall inactivity procedure is applicable only to a UE configured for
eCall only mode as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]. The procedure shall
be started when:

- the UE is in any EMM-REGISTERED substate except substates
EMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH or EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

- the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode; and

- one of the following conditions applies:

1) timer T3444 expires or is found to have already expired and timer
T3445 is not running;

2) timer T3445 expires or is found to have already expired and timer
T3444 is not running; or

3) timers T3444 and T3445 expire or are found to have already expired.

The UE shall then perform the following actions:

- stop other running timers (e.g. T3411, T3412);

- if the UE is currently registered to EPS services only, perform a
detach procedure for EPS services only;

- if the UE is currently registered for both EPS services and non-EPS
services, perform a combined detach procedure for EPS services and
non-EPS services;

- delete any GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI, list of
equivalent PLMNs, and eKSI; and

- enter EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state.

5.5.5 Tracking area update request message (for N1 mode only)

The tracking area updating procedure is used to construct a TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message for the inter-system change from S1 mode to
N1 mode for further security verification by the MME.

The TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is created by EMM by request of
5GMM which further includes the message in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message as described in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

The TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message shall contain only mandatory
information elements.

The UE shall set the EPS update type IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message to "TA updating".

The UE shall include the eKSI (either KSI_(ASME) or KSI_(SGSN)) in the
NAS Key Set Identifier IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.
The UE shall integrity protect the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message
with the current EPS security context and increase the uplink NAS COUNT
by one. The UE shall set associated GUTI in the Old GUTI IE.

When the UE is in EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE substate and needs to
construct the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message for inter-system
change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE shall consider that the tracking
area updating procedure is not initiated and the UE shall remain in
EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE state.

5.5.6 Attach request message (for N1 mode only)

The attach procedure is used to construct an ATTACH REQUEST message for
a UE performing a registration procedure for initial registration when

a) the UE:

1) previously was registered in S1 mode before entering state
EMM-DEREGISTERED; and

2) has received an "interworking without N26 interface not supported"
indication from the network; and

b) EPS security context and a valid 4G-GUTI are available.

The ATTACH REQUEST message is created by EMM by request of 5GMM which
further includes the message in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message as
described in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

The ATTACH REQUEST message shall contain only mandatory information
elements.

The UE shall set the EPS attach type IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message to
"EPS attach".

The UE shall include the eKSI (KSI_(ASME)) in the NAS Key Set Identifier
IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message. The UE shall integrity protect the
ATTACH REQUEST message with the current EPS security context and
increase the uplink NAS COUNT by one.

The UE shall set associated GUTI in the EPS mobile identity IE.

The UE shall set the UE network capability IE according to its
capabilities.

The UE shall include an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE in the ESM message container
IE.

5.6 EMM connection management procedures (S1 mode only)

5.6.1 Service request procedure

5.6.1.1 General

The purpose of the service request procedure is to transfer the EMM mode
from EMM-IDLE to EMM-CONNECTED mode. If the UE is not using EPS services
with control plane CIoT EPS optimization, this procedure is used to
establish the radio and S1 bearers when user data or signalling is to be
sent. If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, this procedure can be used for UE initiated transfer of
user data via the control plane. Another purpose of this procedure is to
invoke MO/MT CS fallback or 1xCS fallback procedures.

This procedure is used when:

- the network has downlink signalling pending;

- the UE has uplink signalling pending;

- the UE or the network has user data pending and the UE is in EMM-IDLE
mode;

- the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode and has a NAS signalling connection
only; the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, and it has user data pending which is to be transferred
via user plane radio bearers;

- the UE in EMM-IDLE or EMM-CONNECTED mode has requested to perform
mobile originating/terminating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback;

- the network has downlink cdma2000^(®) signalling pending;

- the UE has uplink cdma2000^(®) signalling pending;

- the UE has to request resources for ProSe direct discovery or Prose
direct communication;

- the UE has to request resources for V2X communication over PC5;

- the UE that is MUSIM UE and in EMM-IDLE mode requests the network to
remove the paging restriction; or

- to indicate to the network that the MUSIM UE requests the release of
the NAS signalling connection or reject paging.

The service request procedure is initiated by the UE, however, for the
downlink transfer of signalling, cdma2000^(®) signalling or user data in
EMM-IDLE mode, the trigger is given by the network by means of the
paging procedure (see clause 5.6.2).

The UE shall invoke the service request procedure when:

a) the UE in EMM-IDLE mode receives a paging request using S-TMSI with
CN domain indicator set to "PS" from the network;

NOTE: As an implementation option, the MUSIM UE is allowed to not
respond to paging based on the information available in the paging
message, e.g. voice service indication.

b) the UE, in EMM-IDLE mode, has pending user data to be sent;

c) the UE, in EMM-IDLE mode, has uplink signalling pending;

d) the UE in EMM-IDLE or EMM-CONNECTED mode is configured to use CS
fallback and has a mobile originating CS fallback request from the upper
layer;

e) the UE in EMM-IDLE mode is configured to use CS fallback and receives
a paging request with CN domain indicator set to "CS", or the UE in
EMM-CONNECTED mode is configured to use CS fallback and receives a CS
SERVICE NOTIFICATION message;

f) the UE in EMM-IDLE or EMM-CONNECTED mode is configured to use 1xCS
fallback and has a mobile originating 1xCS fallback request from the
upper layer;

g) the UE in EMM-CONNECTED mode is configured to use 1xCS fallback and
accepts cdma2000^(®) signalling messages containing a 1xCS paging
request received over E-UTRAN;

h) the UE, in EMM-IDLE mode, has uplink cdma2000^(®) signalling pending
to be transmitted over E-UTRAN;

i) the UE, in EMM-IDLE or EMM-CONNECTED mode, is configured to use 1xCS
fallback, accepts cdma2000^(®) signalling messages containing a 1xCS
paging request received over cdma2000^(®) 1xRTT, and the network
supports dual Rx CSFB or provide CS fallback registration parameters
(see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]);

j) the UE, in EMM-IDLE or EMM-CONNECTED mode, has uplink cdma2000^(®)
signalling pending to be transmitted over cdma2000^(®) 1xRTT, and the
network supports dual Rx CSFB or provide CS fallback registration
parameters (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]);

k) the UE performs an inter-system change from S101 mode to S1 mode and
has user data pending;

l) the UE in EMM-IDLE mode has to request resources for ProSe direct
discovery or Prose direct communication (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]);

m) the UE, in EMM-CONNECTED mode and has a NAS signalling connection
only, is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization and
has pending user data to be sent via user plane radio bearers;

n) the UE in EMM-IDLE mode has to request resources for V2X
communication over PC5 (see 3GPP TS 23.285 [47]);

o) the network supports the paging restriction and the UE that is MUSIM
UE and in EMM-IDLE mode is requesting the network to remove the paging
restriction;

p) the network supports the NAS signalling connection release and the
MUSIM UE in EMM-CONNECTED mode requests the network to release the NAS
signalling connection and, if the network supports the paging
restriction, optionally includes paging restriction; or

q) the network supports the reject paging request and the MUSIM UE, in
EMM-IDLE mode when responding to paging rejects the paging request from
the network, requests the network to release the NAS signalling
connection and, if the network supports the paging restriction,
optionally includes paging restriction.

If one of the above criteria to invoke the service request procedure is
fulfilled, then the service request procedure may only be initiated by
the UE when the following conditions are fulfilled:

- its EPS update status is EU1 UPDATED, and the current TAI of the
current serving cell is included in the TAI list; and

- no EMM specific procedure is ongoing.

The MUSIM UE shall not initiate service request procedure for requesting
the network to release the NAS signalling connection if the UE is
attached for emergency bearer services or if the UE has a PDN connection
for emergency bearer services established. To enable the emergency call
back, the UE shall not initiate service request procedure for requesting
the network to release the NAS signalling connection for a UE
implementation-specific duration of time after the completion of the
emergency bearer services.

[]

NOTE 1: AS indications (indications from lower layers) are results of
procedures triggered by MME in service request procedure. Triggered
procedures could be e.g. RRC connection reconfiguration procedure (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) and inter system PS handover to GERAN or UTRAN
procedure as a result of CSFB procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.272 [9]).

NOTE 2: For 1xCS fallback, the UE sends the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST
message and starts timer T3417. The procedure is considered completed
upon receiving indication of system change from AS.

NOTE 1: Security protected NAS message: this could be e.g. a SECURITY
MODE COMMAND, SERVICE ACCEPT, or ESM DATA TRANSPORT message.

NOTE 2: AS indications (indications from lower layers) are results of
procedures triggered by MME in service request procedure. Triggered
procedures could be e.g. an RRC connection release procedure or RRC
connection reconfiguration procedure (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

Figure 5.6.1.1.2: Service request procedure (part 2)

A service request attempt counter is used to limit the number of service
request attempts and no response from the network. The service request
attempt counter shall be incremented as specified in clause 5.6.1.6.

The service request attempt counter shall be reset when:

- a normal or periodic tracking area updating or a combined tracking
area updating procedure is successfully completed;

- a service request procedure in order to obtain packet services is
successfully completed;

- a service request procedure is rejected as specified in clause 5.6.1.5
or clause 5.3.7b; or

- the UE moves to EMM-DEREGISTERED state.

5.6.1.2 Service request procedure initiation

5.6.1.2.1 UE is not using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization

For cases a, b, c, h, k, l and o in clause 5.6.1.1:

initiates the service request procedure by sending a SERVICE REQUEST
message to the MME;

- if the UE is configured for NAS signalling low priority, and the last
received ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
from the network indicated that the network supports use of EXTENDED
SERVICE REQUEST for packet services, the UE shall send an EXTENDED

S1"; or

NOTE: A UE configured for dual priority is configured for NAS signalling
low priority indicator.

- if the UE is configured for NAS signalling low priority and the last
received ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message
from the network did not indicate that the network supports use of
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST for packet services, the UE shall instead send

response IE indicating "CS fallback accepted by the UE", start
T3417ext-mt and enter the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED; or

- if the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode and if the UE rejects the paging,
the UE shall send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message with the CSFB
response IE indicating "CS fallback rejected by the UE" and enter the
state EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. The network shall not initiate CS
fallback procedures.

For cases f, g, i and j in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall send an EXTENDED
SERVICE REQUEST message, start T3417 and enter the state
EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED.

For case o in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE may send an EXTENDED SERVICE
REQUEST message with Service type set to "packet services via S1" and
Request type set to "NAS signalling connection release" in the UE
request type IE to remove the paging restriction and request the release
of the NAS signalling connection at the same time. The UE shall start
T3417 and enter the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED. The UE shall
not include the Paging restriction IE in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST
message.

For cases p and q in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall send an EXTENDED

include its paging restriction preference in the Paging restriction IE
in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message.

5.6.1.2.2 UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization

The UE shall send a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, start T3417
and enter the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED.

For case a in clause 5.6.1.1, the Control plane service type of the
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message shall indicate "mobile terminating
request". The UE may include the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message. The UE
shall not include any ESM message other than ESM DATA TRANSPORT message.

For case b in clause 5.6.1.1,

- if the UE has pending IP, non-IP or Ethernet user data that is to be
sent via the control plane radio bearers, the Control plane service type
of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message shall indicate "mobile
originating request". The UE shall include an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message
in the ESM message container IE. If the UE supports the CP-EDT (see
3GPP TS 36.300 [20]), the UE shall provide the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message in the NAS request to the lower layer to establish a RRC
connection as specified in clause 5.3.1.1.

For cases b and m in clause 5.6.1.1,

- if the UE has pending IP, non-IP or Ethernet user data that is to be
sent via the user plane radio bearers, the UE shall set the Control
plane service type of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message to
"mobile originating request" and the "active" flag in the Control plane
service type IE to 1. The UE shall not include any ESM message container
or NAS message container IE in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
message.

For case c in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall set the Control plane service
type of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message to "mobile originating
request". If the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message is:

- for sending SMS, the UE shall include the SMS message in the NAS
message container IE and shall not include any ESM message container IE
in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message; and

- for sending signalling different from SMS, the UE shall not include
any ESM message container or NAS message container IE in the CONTROL
PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

For cases p and q in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall send the CONTROL PLANE

- for case q in clause 5.6.1.1 set Request type to "Rejection of paging"
in the UE request type IE and Control plane service type IE to "mobile
terminating request"; and

start T3417 and enter the state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED. Further,
the UE may include its paging restriction preference in the Paging
restriction IE in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and shall
not include any ESM message container or NAS message container IE in the
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

For case o in clause 5.6.1.1, the Control plane service type of the
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message shall indicate "mobile originating
request". The UE shall not include the Paging restriction IE in the
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message. The UE may include the UE request
type IE and set Request type to "NAS signalling connection release" to
remove the paging restriction and request the release of the NAS
signalling connection at the same time. If the UE requests the release
of the NAS signalling connection, the UE shall not include any ESM
message container or NAS message container IE in the CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST message.

5.6.1.3 EMM common procedure initiation

Upon receipt of the SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL
PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, the MME may initiate the EMM common
procedures, e.g. the authentication procedure and security mode control
procedure.

5.6.1.4 Service request procedure accepted by the network

5.6.1.4.1 UE is not using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME and the MME has no active EPS bearer contexts for the UE, for cases
a, b, c and o in clause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the SERVICE REQUEST
message or the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for packet services,
after completion of the EMM common procedures according to
clause 5.6.1.3, if any, the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME and the UE has no active EPS bearer contexts, for cases a, b, c and
o in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the receipt of a SERVICE ACCEPT
message as successful completion of the procedure. Otherwise, for cases
a, b, c, h, k, l and o in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the
indication from the lower layers that the user plane radio bearer is set
up as successful completion of the procedure. The UE shall reset the
service request attempt counter, stop the timer T3417 and enter the
state EMM-REGISTERED.

If the service type information element in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST
message indicates "mobile terminating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback" and
the CSFB response IE, if included, indicates "CS fallback accepted by
the UE", or if the service type information element in the EXTENDED
SERVICE REQUEST message indicates "mobile originating CS fallback or
1xCS fallback" or "mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS
fallback emergency call", the network initiates CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback procedures.

If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the EXTENDED SERVICE
REQUEST message, the network shall deactivate all those EPS bearer
contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between the network
and the UE) which are active on the network side but are indicated by
the UE as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as
inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the EXTENDED
SERVICE REQUEST message, and this default bearer is not associated with
the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, the MME shall
locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN
connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM
signalling to the UE. If the default bearer is associated with the last
remaining PDN connection of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED
without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the MME shall
locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN
connection with the default EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM
signalling to the UE. If the default EPS bearer context of a PDN
connection established as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU session as
specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 24.193 [61] is deactivated locally
and the MA PDU session does not have user plane resources established on
non-3GPP access in N1 mode, the network shall perform a local release of
the MA PDU session.

If the SERVICE REQUEST message or the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message
for packet services, was sent in a CSG cell and the CSG subscription has
expired or was removed for a UE, but the UE has a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services established, the network shall accept the
SERVICE REQUEST message or the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for
packet services and deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers locally.
The emergency EPS bearers shall not be deactivated.

For cases d in clause 5.6.1.1, and for case e in clause 5.6.1.1 when the
CSFB response was set to "CS fallback accepted by the UE", the UE shall
treat the indication from the lower layers that the inter-system change
from S1 mode to A/Gb or Iu mode is completed as successful completion of
the procedure. The EMM sublayer in the UE shall indicate to the MM
sublayer that the CS fallback procedure has succeeded. The UE shall stop
the timer T3417ext or T3417ext-mt, respectively, and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.

If the service request procedure was initiated in EMM-IDLE mode and an
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message was sent in a CSG cell and the CSG
subscription has expired or was removed for the UE, the network need not
perform CSG access control if the service type information element
indicates "mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS
fallback emergency call".

For cases f and g in clause 5.6.1.1:

- if the UE receives the indication from the lower layers that the
signalling connection is released with the redirection indication to
cdma2000^(®) 1x access network or the indication from the lower layers
that a change to cdma2000^(®) 1x access network for 1xCS fallback has
started (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the UE shall consider the service
request procedure successfully completed, stop timer T3417 and enter the
state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE;

- if the UE receives the dual Rx/Tx redirection indication from the
lower layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the UE shall select cdma2000^(®)
1x access network for 1xCS fallback, consider the service request
procedure successfully completed, stop timer T3417 and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE; and

- if the UE receives a cdma2000^(®) signalling message indicating 1xCS
fallback rejection by cdma2000^(®) 1x access network, the UE shall abort
the service request procedure, stop timer T3417 and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

For cases i and j in clause 5.6.1.1, if the UE receives the indication
from the lower layers that the signalling connection is released, the UE
shall consider the service request procedure successfully completed,
stop timer T3417 and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.NO-CELL-AVAILABLE.

For cases o, p and q in clause 5.6.1.1, when the MUSIM UE in the
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message sets the Request type to "NAS
signalling connection release" or to "Rejection of paging" in the UE
request type IE, the UE shall treat the receipt of SERVICE ACCEPT
message as the successful completion of the procedure and the UE shall
reset the service request attempt counter, stop timer T3417 and enter
the state EMM-REGISTERED.

If the SERVICE REQUEST message or an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message
for packet services was used, the UE shall locally deactivate the EPS
bearer contexts that do not have a user plane radio bearer established
upon successful completion of the service request procedure, except for
the case when the MUSIM UE in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message sets
the Request type to "NAS signalling connection release" or to "Rejection
of paging" in the UE request type IE.

If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message is for CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback and radio bearer establishment takes place during the
procedure, the UE shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer contexts that
do not have a user plane radio bearer established upon receiving a lower
layer indication of radio bearer establishment. The UE does not perform
local deactivation of EPS bearer contexts upon receiving an indication
of inter-system change from lower layers.

If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message is for CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback and radio bearer establishment does not take place during the
procedure, the UE does not perform local deactivation of the EPS bearer
context. The UE does not perform local deactivation of EPS bearer
contexts upon receiving an indication of inter-system change from lower
layers.

If a service request is received from a UE with a LIPA PDN connection,
and if:

- a GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is provided
by the lower layer together with the service request, and the P-GW
address included in the EPS bearer context of the LIPA PDN connection is
different from the provided GW Transport Layer Address IE value (see
3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

- no GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the service
request by the lower layer;

then the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts associated
with any LIPA PDN connection. Furthermore, if no active EPS bearer
contexts remain for the UE, the MME shall not accept the service request
as specified in clause 5.6.1.5.

If a service request is received from a UE with a SIPTO at the local
network PDN connection, and if the PDN connection is a:

1) SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with stand-alone GW, and
if:

- a LHN-ID value is provided by the lower layer together with the
service request, and the LHN-ID value stored in the EPS bearer context
of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is different from the
provided LHN-ID value (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

- no LHN-ID value is provided together with the service request by the
lower layer; or

2) SIPTO at the local network PDN connection with collocated L-GW, and
if:

- a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address IE value identifying a L-GW is
provided by the lower layer together with the service request, and the
P-GW address included in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the
local network PDN connection is different from the provided SIPTO L-GW
Transport Layer Address IE value (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

- no SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address is provided together with the
service request by the lower layer;

then, the MME takes one of the following actions:

- if all the remaining PDN connections are SIPTO at the local network
PDN connections, the MME shall not accept the service request as
specified in clause 5.6.1.5; and

- if a PDN connection remains that is not SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection and the network decides to set up the S1 and radio bearers,
the MME shall upon completion of the setup of the S1 bearers initiate an
EPS bearer context deactivation procedure with ESM cause #39
"reactivation requested" for the default EPS bearer context of each
SIPTO at the local network PDN connection (see clause 6.4.4.2).

NOTE: For some cases of CS fallback or 1x CS fallback the network can
decide not to set up any S1 and radio bearers.

Upon receipt of the SERVICE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any
stored paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging.

If the MUSIM UE does not include the Paging restriction IE in the
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored paging
restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging.

For cases p and q in clause 5.6.1.1 when the MUSIM UE sets the Request
type to "NAS signalling connection release" or to "Rejection of paging"
in the UE request type IE in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message and if
the UE requests restriction of paging by including the Paging
restriction IE, the MME:

- if accepts the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional
request result IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and set the Paging
restriction decision to "paging restriction is accepted". The MME shall
store the paging restriction of the UE and enforce these restrictions in
the paging procedure as described in clause 5.6.2; or

- if rejects the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional
request result IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and set the Paging
restriction decision to "paging restriction is rejected", and shall
discard the received paging restriction. The MME shall delete any stored
paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging; and

- shall initiate the release of the NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the service request procedure.

When the E-UTRAN fails to establish radio bearers for one or more EPS
bearer contexts, then the MME shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer
contexts corresponding to the failed radio bearers based on the lower
layer indication from the E‑UTRAN, without notifying the UE.

If the UE is not using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the network shall consider the service request procedure
successfully completed in the following cases:

- when it receives an indication from the lower layer that the user
plane is setup, if radio bearer establishment is required;

- otherwise when it receives an indication from the lower layer that the
UE has been redirected to the other RAT (GERAN or UTRAN in CS fallback,
or cdma2000^(®) 1x access network for 1xCS fallback).

5.6.1.4.2 UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization

For case a in clause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message with Control plane service type indicating "mobile
terminating request", after completion of the EMM common procedures
according to clause 5.6.1.3:

1) if the MME needs to perform an EPS bearer context status
synchronization

- for an EPS bearer context associated with Control plane only
indication; or

- for an EPS bearer context not associated with Control plane only
indication, there is no downlink user data pending to be delivered via
the user plane, and the UE did not set the "active" flag in the Control
plane service type IE to 1;

2) if the control plane data back-off time for the UE is stored in MME
and the MME decides to deactivate congestion control for transport of
user data via the control plane, or

3) if the MME needs to provide the UE with Forbidden TAI(s) for the list
of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" IE or Forbidden TAI(s) for the
list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE,

then the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message.

Furthermore the MME may:

1) initiate the transport of user data via the control plane procedure
or any other NAS signalling procedure;

2) if supported by the UE and required by the network, initiate the
setup of the user plane radio bearer(s); or

3) send a NAS signalling message not related to an EMM common procedure
to the UE if downlink signalling is pending.

For case b in clause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message with Control plane service type indicating "mobile
originating request", after completion of the EMM common procedures
according to clause 5.6.1.3, if any, if the MME needs to provide the UE
with Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" IE or Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking
areas for regional provision of service" IE or to perform an EPS bearer
context status synchronization

- for an EPS bearer context associated with Control plane only
indication; or

- for an EPS bearer context not associated with Control plane only
indication, there is no downlink user data pending to be delivered via
the user plane, and the UE did not set the "active" flag in the Control
plane service type IE to 1,

then the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message.

Furthermore, the MME may:

1) initiate release of the NAS signalling connection upon receipt of an
indication from the ESM layer (see clause 6.6.4.2), unless the MME has
additional downlink user data or signalling pending;

2) initiate the setup of the user plane radio bearer(s), if downlink
user data is pending to be delivered via the user plane or the UE has
set the "active" flag in the Control plane service type IE to 1;

3) send an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message to the UE, if downlink user data
is pending to be delivered via the control plane;

4) send a NAS signalling message not related to an EMM common procedure
to the UE if downlink signalling is pending; or

5) send a SERVICE ACCEPT message to complete the service request
procedure, if no NAS security mode control procedure was initiated, the
MME did not send a SERVICE ACCEPT message as specified above to perform
an EPS bearer context status synchronization, and the MME did not
initiate any of the procedures specified in item 1 to 4 above.

NOTE 1: The MME can initiate the setup of the user plane radio bearer(s)
if the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of
user data via the control plane.

For case m in clause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message with Control plane service type indicating "mobile
originating request" and the "active" flag in the Control plane service
type IE set to 1:

1) if the MME accepts the request, the MME shall initiate the setup of
the user plane radio bearer(s) for all active EPS bearer contexts of SGi
PDN connections that are established without control plane only
indication.

2) if the MME does not accept the request, the MME shall send a SERVICE
ACCEPT message to complete the service request procedure.

NOTE 2: The MME takes into account the maximum number of user plane
radio bearers supported by the UE, in addition to local policies and the
UE's preferred CIoT network behaviour when deciding whether to accept
the request to establish user plane bearer(s) as described in
clause 5.3.15. If the MME accepts the request, all SGi PDN connections
are considered as established without Control plane only indication.

NOTE 3: In this release of the specification, a UE in NB-S1 mode can
support a maximum of 2 user plane radio bearers (see clause 6.5.0).

For case c in clause 5.6.1.1, upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message with Control plane service type indicating "mobile
originating request" and without an ESM message container IE, after
completion of the EMM common procedures according to clause 5.6.1.3, if
any, the MME proceeds as follows:

If the MME needs to perform an EPS bearer context status synchronization

- for an EPS bearer context associated with Control plane only
indication; or

- for an EPS bearer context not associated with Control plane only
indication, and there is no downlink user data pending to be delivered
via the user plane,

then the MME shall send a SERVICE ACCEPT message.

Furthermore, the MME may:

1) initiate the setup of the user plane radio bearer(s), if downlink
user data is pending to be delivered via the user plane;

2) send an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message to the UE, if downlink user data
is pending to be delivered via the control plane;

3) send a NAS signalling message not related to an EMM common procedure
to the UE, if downlink signalling is pending; or

4) send a SERVICE ACCEPT message to complete the service request
procedure, if no NAS security mode control procedure was initiated, the
MME did not send a SERVICE ACCEPT message as specified above to perform
an EPS bearer context status synchronization, and the MME did not
initiate any of the procedures specified in item 1 to 3 above.

If the MUSIM UE does not include the Paging restriction IE in the
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, the MME shall delete any stored
paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging.

For cases p and q in clause 5.6.1.1 when the MUSIM UE sets the Request
type to "NAS signalling connection release" or to "Rejection of paging"
in the UE request type IE in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
and if the UE requests restriction of paging by including the Paging
restriction IE, the MME:

- if accepts the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional
request result IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and set the Paging
restriction decision to "paging restriction is accepted". The MME shall
store the paging restriction of the UE, enforce these restrictions in
the paging procedure as described in clause 5.6.2; or

- if rejects the paging restriction, shall include the EPS additional
request result IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and set the Paging
restriction decision to "paging restriction is rejected", and shall
discard the received paging restriction. The MME shall delete any stored
paging restriction for the UE and stop restricting paging; and

- shall initiate the release of the NAS signalling connection after the
completion of the service request procedure.

In NB-S1 mode, for cases a, b, c and m in clause 5.6.1.1, if the MME
needs to initiate the setup of user plane radio bearer(s), the MME shall
check if the UE can support the establishment of additional user plane
radio bearer based on the multiple DRB support indicated by UE in the UE
network capability IE.

For cases a, b and c in clause 5.6.1.1, if the EPS bearer context status
IE is included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, the network
shall deactivate all those EPS bearer contexts locally (without
peer-to-peer signalling between the network and the UE) which are active
on the network side but are indicated by the UE as being inactive. If a
default EPS bearer context is marked as inactive in the EPS bearer
context status IE included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message,
and this default bearer is not associated with the last PDN connection
of the UE in the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer
contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer
context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE. If the default
bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection of the UE in
the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the
UE and the MME, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS bearer contexts
associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS bearer context
without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE.

If the EPS bearer context status IE is included in the CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST and the MME decides to respond with a SERVICE ACCEPT
message, the MME shall include an EPS bearer context status IE,
indicating which EPS bearer contexts are active in the MME, except for
the case when no EPS bearer context exists on the network side.

If the MME needs to initiate an EPS bearer context status
synchronization, the MME may include an EPS bearer context status IE in
the SERVICE ACCEPT message also if no EPS bearer context status IE was
included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

If the MME sends a SERVICE ACCEPT message upon receipt of the CONTROL
PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message piggybacked with the ESM DATA TRANSPORT
message:

- if the Release assistance indication IE is set to "No further uplink
and no further downlink data transmission subsequent to the uplink data
transmission is expected" in the message;

- if the UE has indicated support for the control plane data back-off
timer; and

- if the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of
user data via the control plane,

then the MME shall include the T3448 value IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT
message.

If the MME sends a SERVICE ACCEPT message and decides to deactivate
congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane then
the MME shall delete the stored control plane data back-off time for the
UE and the MME shall not include timer T3448 value IE in SERVICE ACCEPT
message.

For cases a, b, c and m in clause 5.6.1.1, if the EPS bearer context
status IE is included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message or
the MME needs to initiate an EPS bearer context status synchronization,
the MME shall consider the service request procedure successfully
completed when it sends the SERVICE ACCEPT message. If the EPS bearer
context status IE is not included in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST
message and the MME does not need to initiate an EPS bearer context
status synchronization, the MME shall consider the service request
procedure successfully completed in the following cases:

- when it successfully completes a NAS security mode control procedure;

- when it receives an indication from the lower layer that the user
plane is setup, if radio bearer establishment is required;

- upon receipt of the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and
completion of the EMM common procedures, if any, if the CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST message was successfully integrity checked and the ESM
message container or NAS message container in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message, if applicable, was successfully deciphered, radio
bearer establishment is not required, and the MME has downlink user data
or signalling not related to an EMM common procedure pending; and

- with the transmission of a SERVICE ACCEPT message or with the decision
to initiate release of the NAS signalling connection, if the CONTROL
PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message was successfully integrity checked and the
ESM message container or NAS message container in the CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST message, if applicable, was successfully deciphered,
radio bearer establishment is not required, and the MME does not have
any downlink user data or signalling pending.

If the MME considers the service request procedure successfully
completed the MME shall:

1) forward the contents of the ESM message container IE, if any, to the
ESM layer; and

2) forward the contents of the NAS message container IE, if any.

For cases a, b and c in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the receipt
of any of the following as successful completion of the procedure:

- a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message;

- a security protected EMM message different from a SERVICE REJECT
message and not related to an EMM common procedure;

- a security protected ESM message; and

- receipt of the indication from the lower layers that the user plane
radio bearers are set up.

Upon successful completion of the procedure, the UE shall reset the
service request attempt counter, stop the timer T3417 and enter the
state EMM-REGISTERED.

If the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message was sent with the "active"
flag in the Control plane service type IE set to "Radio bearer
establishment requested", the UE shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer
contexts that do not have a user plane radio bearer established upon
successful completion of the service request procedure, except for the
case when the MUSIM UE in the CONTROL SERVICE REQUEST message sets the
Request type to "NAS signalling connection release" or to "Rejection of
paging" in the UE request type IE.

NOTE 4: The security protected EMM message can be e.g. a SERVICE ACCEPT
message and the ESM message an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message.

For case m in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the indication from the
lower layers that the user plane radio bearers are set up as successful
completion of the procedure. The UE shall treat the receipt of a SERVICE
ACCEPT message as completion of the procedure without the establishment
of the user plane radio bearers. For both cases, the UE shall reset the
service request attempt counter, stop the timer T3417 and enter the
state EMM-REGISTERED.

For case b in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall also treat the indication
from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been released as
successful completion of the procedure. The UE shall reset the service
request attempt counter, stop the timer T3417 and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.

For cases a, c and m in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the
indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been
released as an abnormal case and shall follow the procedure described in
clause 5.6.1.6, item b.

For cases p and q in clause 5.6.1.1, when the MUSIM UE in the CONTROL
PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message sets the Request type to "NAS signalling
connection release" or to "Rejection of paging" in the UE request type
IE, the UE shall treat the receipt of SERVICE ACCEPT message as the
successful completion of the procedure and the UE shall reset the
service request attempt counter, stop timer T3417, enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED and not deactivate EPS bearer contexts locally.

For case o in clause 5.6.1.1, the UE shall treat the receipt of SERVICE
ACCEPT message as the successful completion of the procedure. The UE
shall reset the service request attempt counter, stop timer T3417 and
enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.

For cases a, b and c in clause 5.6.1.1,

- if the MME needs to initiate an EPS bearer context status
synchronization or to provide the UE with Forbidden TAI(s) for the list
of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" IE or Forbidden TAI(s) for the
list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service",
the UE can receive a SERVICE ACCEPT message even after it received a
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message or an indication from the lower layers
that the user plane radio bearers are set up and determined successful
completion of the service request procedure. Upon receipt of the
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message or an indication from the lower layers
that the user plane radio bearers are set up, the UE shall start timer
T3449. If the UE receives a security protected ESM message or a security
protected EMM message not related to an EMM common procedure, the UE
shall stop the timer T3449. If the UE receives a SERVICE ACCEPT message
while the timer T3449 is running, the UE shall treat the SERVICE ACCEPT
message and stop the timer T3449. If the UE is not in state
EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED and timer T3449 is not running, the
receipt of the SERVICE ACCEPT message is considered as protocol error
and the UE shall return EMM STATUS message as specified in clause 7.4;
otherwise the UE shall treat the SERVICE ACCEPT message; and

- if the UE treats the SERVICE ACCEPT message and an EPS bearer context
status IE is included in the message, the UE shall deactivate all those
EPS bearers contexts locally (without peer-to-peer signalling between
the UE and the MME) which are active in the UE, but are indicated by the
MME as being inactive. If a default EPS bearer context is marked as
inactive in the EPS bearer context status IE included in the SERVICE
ACCEPT message, and this default bearer is not associated with the last
remaining PDN connection in the UE, the UE shall locally deactivate all
EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default
EPS bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME. If
the default bearer is associated with the last remaining PDN connection
of the UE in the MME, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS
bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS
bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the MME.

If the T3448 value IE is present in the received SERVICE ACCEPT message,
the UE shall:

- stop timer T3448 if it is running;

- consider the transport of user data via the control plane as
successful; and

- start timer T3448 with the value provided in the T3448 value IE.

If the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the T3448 value IE is present in the SERVICE ACCEPT
message and the value indicates that this timer is either zero or
deactivated, the UE shall consider this case as an abnormal case and
proceed as if the T3448 value IE is not present.

If the UE in EMM-IDLE mode initiated the service request procedure by
sending a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message and the SERVICE ACCEPT
message does not include the T3448 value IE and if timer T3448 is
running, then the UE shall stop timer T3448.

If the MME received the list of TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as
described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], and determines that, by UE
subscription and operator's preference, any but not all TAIs in the
received list of TAIs is forbidden for roaming or for regional provision
of service, the MME shall include the TAI(s) in:

a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" IE;

b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service" IE; or

c) both,

in the SERVICE ACCEPT message.

NOTE 5: "Forbidden tracking areas for roaming" corresponds to cause
values #13 and #15, and "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision
of service" corresponds cause value #12.

If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming" IE in the SERVICE ACCEPT message and the
TAI(s) included in the IE which are belonging to the serving PLMN or
equivalent PLMN(s) is not part of the list of "forbidden tracking areas
for roaming", the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the
list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" and ignore the TAI(s)
which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s).

If the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE in the SERVICE
ACCEPT message and the TAI(s) included in the IE which are belonging to
the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) is not part of the list of
"forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service", the UE
shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE into the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service" and ignore the TAI(s)
which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s).

5.6.1.5 Service request procedure not accepted by the network

If the service request cannot be accepted, the network shall return a
SERVICE REJECT message to the UE including an appropriate EMM cause
value.

NOTE 1: A service request can only be rejected before the network has
initiated any procedure which will be interpreted by the UE as
successful completion of the service request procedure (see
clauses 5.6.1.4.1 and 5.6.1.4.2) and which will trigger a transition
from state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED to EMM-REGISTERED on the UE
side.

Based on local policies or configurations in the MME, if the MME
determines to change the periodic tracking area update timer (T3412), or
if the MME determines to change the PSM usage or the value of timer
T3324 in the UE for which PSM is allowed by the MME, the MME may return
a SERVICE REJECT with the cause #10 "implicitly detached" to the UE.

Based on operator policy, if the service request procedure is rejected
due to core network redirection for CIoT optimizations, the network
shall set the EMM cause value to #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required".

NOTE 2: The network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability,
the 5GS CIoT network behaviour supported by the UE or the 5GS CIoT
network behaviour supported by the 5GCN to determine the rejection with
the EMM cause value #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required".

The MME may be configured to perform MME-based access control for mobile
originating CS fallback calls for a certain area A by rejecting related
service request with EMM cause #39 "CS service temporarily not
available".

NOTE 3: Dependent on implementation and operator configuration the area
A can be configured with the granularity of an MME area, tracking area
or eNodeB service area.

The MME may further be configured for a certain area A' to exempt
service requests for mobile originating CS fallback calls from this
MME-based access control, if:

- the service request is initiated in EMM-IDLE mode; and

- the UE indicated support of eNodeB-based access control for mobile
originating CS fallback calls during an attach or tracking area updating
procedure.

NOTE 4: The operator can use this second option when the eNodeBs in area
A' are supporting the eNodeB-based access control for CS fallback calls.
The area A' can be part of area A or the whole area A. It is the
responsibility of the operator to coordinate the activation of MME-based
access control and eNodeB-based access control for mobile originating CS
fallback calls.

When the EMM cause value is #39 "CS service temporarily not available",
the MME shall include a value for timer T3442 in the SERVICE REJECT
message. If a mobile terminating CS fallback call is aborted by the
network during call establishment as specified in 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A],
the MME shall include the EMM cause value #39 "CS service temporarily
not available" and set the value of timer T3442 to zero.

If a service request from a UE with only LIPA PDN connections is not
accepted due to the reasons specified in clause 5.6.1.4, depending on
the service request received, the MME shall include the following EMM
cause value in the SERVICE REJECT message:

- if the service request received is not due to CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback, EMM cause value #10 "implicitly detached"; or

- if the service request received is due to CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback, EMM cause value #40 "no EPS bearer context activated".

If a service request from a UE with only remaining SIPTO at the local
network PDN connections is not accepted due to the reasons specified in
clause 5.6.1.4, depending on the service request received, the MME
shall:

- if the service request received is due to CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback, include the EMM cause value #40 "no EPS bearer context
activated" in the SERVICE REJECT message; or

- if the service request received is not due to CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback, abort the service request procedure and send a DETACH REQUEST
message to the UE with detach type "re-attach required" (see
clause 5.5.2.3.1).

If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to
general NAS level mobility management congestion control, the network
shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign a value for
back-off timer T3346.

In NB-S1 mode, if the service request for mobile originated services is
rejected due to operator determined barring (see 3GPP TS 29.272 [16C]),
the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and assign
a value for back-off timer T3346.

If the service request for mobile originated services is rejected due to
service gap control as specified in clause 5.3.17 i.e. the T3447 timer
is running, the network shall set the EMM cause value to #22
"congestion" and may assign a back-off timer T3346 with the remaining
time of the running T3447 timer.

If the MME sends a SERVICE REJECT message upon receipt of the CONTROL
PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message piggybacked with the ESM DATA TRANSPORT
message:

- if the Release assistance indication IE is not set to "No further
uplink and no further downlink data transmission subsequent to the
uplink data transmission is expected" in the message;

- if the UE has indicated a support for the control plane data back-off
timer; and

- if the MME decides to activate the congestion control for transport of
user data via the control plane,

then the MME shall set the EMM cause value to #22 "congestion" and
assign a value for control plane data back-off timer T3448.

In NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode via satellite E-UTRAN access, if the service
request is from a UE via a satellite E-UTRA cell and the network using
the User Location Information provided by the eNodeB (see
3GPP TS 36.413 [23]), is able to determine that the UE is in a location
where the network is not allowed to operate, the network shall set the
EMM cause value in the SERVICE REJECT message to #78 "PLMN not allowed
to operate at the present UE location".

On receipt of the SERVICE REJECT message, if the UE is in state
EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED and the message is integrity protected or
contains a reject cause other than EMM cause value #25, the UE shall
reset the service request attempt counter, stop timer T3417, T3417ext or
T3417ext-mt, if running.

If the SERVICE REJECT message with EMM cause #25 or #78 was received
without integrity protection, then the UE shall discard the message.

If the MME received multiple TAIs from the satellite E-UTRAN as
described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10], and determines that, by UE
subscription and operator's preferences, all of the received TAIs are
forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service, the MME
shall include the TAI(s) in:

a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
roaming" IE;

b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden tracking areas for
regional provision of service" IE; or

c) both,

in the SERVICE REJECT message.

Regardless of the EMM cause value received in the SERVICE REJECT message
via satellite E-UTRAN,

- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for roaming" IE in the SERVICE REJECT message, the UE
shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE which are belonging to the
serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s), if not already stored, into the list
of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming" and ignore the TAI(s) which do
not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s); and

- if the UE receives the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "forbidden
tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE in the SERVICE
REJECT message, the UE shall store the TAI(s) included in the IE which
are belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s), if not already
stored, into the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional
provision of service" and ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong to the
serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s).

Furthermore, the UE shall take the following actions depending on the
received EMM cause value in the SERVICE REJECT message.

#3 (Illegal UE);

#6 (Illegal ME); or

#8 (EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed);

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. The UE shall consider
the USIM as invalid for EPS services until switching off or the UICC
containing the USIM is removed or the timer T3245 expires as described
in clause 5.3.7a. Additionally, the UE shall delete the list of
equivalent PLMNs and shall enter the state EMM-DEREGISTERED.NO-IMSI. If
the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS and the
UE maintains a counter for "SIM/USIM considered invalid for GPRS
services", then the UE shall set this counter to UE
implementation-specific maximum value.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall handle the
GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI signature,

and the request was related to CS fallback, the UE shall attempt to
select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology and disable the E-UTRA
capability (see clause 4.5).

If the UE is in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 mode of operation, the UE
may provide a notification to the user or the upper layers that the CS
domain is not available.

If the request was related to 1xCS fallback, the UE shall cancel upper
layer actions related to 1xCS fallback and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE.

#22 (Congestion);

If the T3346 value IE is present in the SERVICE REJECT message and the

of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer.

NOTE 8: If the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile
terminating calls could fail.

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback for emergency call
and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE may
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then
proceeds with appropriate MM and CC specific procedures. The EMM
sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure
to the MM sublayer.

If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall
select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with

the value indicates that this timer is neither zero nor deactivated, the
UE shall:

- stop timer T3448 if it is running;

- consider the transport of user data via the control plane as
unsuccessful; and

- start timer T3448:

- with the value provided in the T3448 value IE if the SERVICE REJECT
message is integrity protected; or

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED, and shall
delete any GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list, eKSI, and list
of equivalent PLMNs. The UE shall start an implementation specific
timer, setting its value to 2 times the value of T as defined in
3GPP TS 23.122 [6]. While this timer is running, the UE shall not
consider the PLMN + RAT combination that provided this reject cause as a
candidate for PLMN selection. The UE then enters state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH in order to perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
set the GMM state to GMM-DEREGISTERED, GPRS update status to GU2 NOT
UPDATED, MM update status to U2 NOT UPDATED and shall delete the P-TMSI,
P-TMSI signature, RAI and GPRS ciphering key sequence number, LAI, TMSI
and ciphering key sequence number.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition set the 5GMM state to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, 5GS update status to
5U2 NOT UPDATED, and shall delete any 5G-GUTI, last visited registered
TAI, TAI list and ngKSI.

#78 (PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location).

This cause value received from a non-satellite E-UTRA cell is considered
as an abnormal case and the behaviour of the UE is specified in
clause 5.5.6.1.6.

The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED (and
shall store it according to clause 5.1.3.3) and shall delete any GUTI,
last visited registered TAI, TAI list and eKSI. Additionally, the UE
shall reset the registration attempt counter. The UE shall store the
PLMN identity and, if it is known, the current geographical location in
the list of "PLMNs not allowed to operate at the present UE location",
start a corresponding timer instance (see subclause 4.11.2), enter state
EMM-DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform a PLMN selection according to
3GPP TS 23.122 [6].

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in
addition handle the 5GMM parameters, 5GMM state, and 5GS update status
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] for the case when the service
request procedure performed over 3GPP access is rejected with the 5GMM
cause with the same value.

Other values are considered as abnormal cases. The specification of the
UE behaviour in those cases is described in clause 5.6.1.6.

5.6.1.5A Service request procedure for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services not accepted by the network

If the service request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services cannot be accepted by the network, the UE shall perform
the procedures as described in clause 5.6.1.5. If the service request
for initiating a PDN connection for emergency bearer services fails due
to receiving the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, the UE shall perform the
procedures as described in clause 5.4.2.5. Then if the UE is in the same
selected PLMN where the last service request was attempted, the UE
shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

NOTE 1: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for
emergency bearer services.

If the service request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services fails due to abnormal case a) in clause 5.6.1.6, the UE
shall perform the actions as described in clause 5.6.1.6 and inform the
upper layers of the failure to access the network.

NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

If the service request for initiating a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services fails due to abnormal cases b), c), e), h) as well as l)
when the "Extended wait time" is ignored, and la) when the "Extended
wait time CP data" is ignored in clause 5.6.1.6, the UE shall perform
the procedures as described in clause 5.6.1.6. Then if the UE is in the
same selected PLMN where the last service request was attempted, the UE
shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure of the procedure; or

NOTE 3: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for
emergency bearer services.

5.6.1.5B Service request procedure for UE attached for access to RLOS not accepted by the network

If the service request for UE attached for access to RLOS cannot be
accepted by the network, the UE shall perform the procedures as
described in clause 5.6.1.5.

Then if:

a) the UE is in the same selected PLMN where the last service request
was attempted and rejected;

b) the service request procedure was rejected with an EMM cause value
other than #9, #10 and #40; and

c) timer T3346 is not running,

the UE shall:

a) detach locally, if not detached already, and perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] to attempt EPS attach for access to RLOS
via another PLMN.

If the service request for UE attached for access to RLOS fails due to
abnormal cases a), b), c) or e) in clause 5.6.1.6, the UE shall perform
the procedures as described in clause 5.6.1.6. Then if the UE is in the
same selected PLMN where the last service request was attempted, the UE
shall:

a) detach locally, if not detached already, and perform a PLMN selection
according to 3GPP TS 23.122 [6] to attempt EPS attach for access to RLOS
via another PLMN.

5.6.1.6 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Access barred because of access class barring, EAB, ACDC or NAS
signalling connection establishment rejected by the network without
"Extended wait time" received from lower layers

In WB-S1 mode, if the service request procedure is started in response
to a paging request from the network, access class barring, EAB or ACDC
is not applicable.

In NB-S1 mode, if the service request procedure is started in response
to a paging request from the network, access barring is not applicable.

If the trigger for the service request procedure is the response to a
paging request from the network and the NAS signalling connection
establishment is rejected by the network, the service request procedure
shall not be started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and
applies normal cell reselection process. During an implementation
dependent time period, the service request procedure may be started when
access for "terminating calls" is granted or upon a cell change.

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and the access is
barred for "mobile originating CS fallback" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22])
and the lower layer indicates "the barring is due to CSFB specific
access barring information", the service request procedure shall not be
started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal
cell reselection process. The service request procedure may be started
if it is still necessary, i.e. when access for "mobile originating CS
fallback" is granted or because of a cell change.

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback
cancellation request was not received and the access is barred for
"mobile originating CS fallback" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) and the lower
layer does not indicate "the barring is due to CSFB specific access
barring information", the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN
radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell,
it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and
the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request
procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate
the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer.

If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback and the access is
barred for "originating calls" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the UE shall
select cdma2000^(®) 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds
with appropriate cdma2000^(®) 1x CS procedures.

If the lower layer indicated the access was barred because of access
class barring for "originating calls" (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]) and if:

- the service request is initiated due to a request from upper layers
for user plane radio resources, and the MO MMTEL voice call is started,
the MO MMTEL video call is started or the MO SMSoIP is started;

- the service request is initiated due to a mobile originated SMS over
NAS or SMS over S102; or

- the service request is initiated due to a request from upper layers
for user plane radio resources, ACDC is applicable to the request and
the UE supports ACDC.

then the service request procedure shall be started. The call type used
shall be per annex D of this document.

NOTE 1: If more than one of MO MMTEL voice call is started, MO MMTEL
video call is started or MO SMSoIP is started conditions are satisfied,
it is left to UE implementation to determine the call type based on
annex D of this document.

If access is barred for a certain ACDC category (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and if the upper layers request user plane radio
resources for a higher ACDC category and the UE supports ACDC, then the
service request procedure shall be started.

If an access request for an uncategorized application is barred due to
ACDC (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and if the upper layers request user
plane radio resources for a certain ACDC category and the UE supports
ACDC, then the service request procedure shall be started.

Otherwise:

- In WB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating calls" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the service request procedure shall not be
started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal
cell reselection process. The service request procedure may be started
if it is still necessary when access for "originating calls" is granted
or because of a cell change.

- In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating calls" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), the service request procedure shall not be
started. The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal
cell reselection process. Further UE behaviour is implementation
specific, e.g. the service request procedure is started again after an
implementation dependent time; or

In NB-S1 mode, if access is barred for "originating calls" (see
3GPP TS 36.331 [22]), and a request for an exceptional event is received
from the upper layers, then the service request procedure shall be
started.

NOTE 2: In NB-S1 mode, the EMM layer cannot receive the access barring
alleviation indication from the lower layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

b) Lower layer failure or release of the NAS signalling connection
without "Extended wait time", without "Extended wait time CP data", and
without redirection indication received from lower layers before the
service request procedure is completed (see clause 5.6.1.4) or before
SERVICE REJECT message is received

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback
cancellation request was not received, the UE shall attempt to select
GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN
or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific
procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the
service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer
shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM
sublayer, and the UE shall also set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT
UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback
cancellation request was received, the UE shall set the EPS update
status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall
either:

- attempt to select cdma2000^(®) 1x radio access technology and proceed
with appropriate cdma2000^(®) 1x CS procedures. If the UE fails to
select cdma2000^(®) 1x radio access technology, the UE shall set the EPS
update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE; or

- set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE, and perform cell selection
according to 3GPP TS 36.304 [21].

If the service request was not initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback, the UE shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.

The UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417,
T3417ext or T3417ext-mt and locally release any resources allocated for
the service request procedure. For case o) in clause 5.6.1.1 the UE may
retry the service request procedure a certain number of times (maximum
re-attempts 5).

c) T3417 expired

The UE shall enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.

If the UE triggered the service request procedure in EMM-IDLE mode in
order to obtain packet services, then the EMM sublayer shall increment
the service request attempt counter, abort the procedure and release
locally any resources allocated for the service request procedure. The
service request counter shall not be incremented, if:

- the service request procedure is initiated to establish a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established;

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the service request is initiated in response to paging from the
network; or

- the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user
data related to an exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use
exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of
the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file
EF_(NASCONFIG) in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

If the service request attempt counter is greater than or equal to 5,
the UE shall start timer T3325 (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). Additionally
if the service request was initiated for an "originating MMTEL voice"
call type or an "originating MMTEL video" call type, a notification that
the service request was not accepted and that timer T3325 is running
shall be provided to the upper layers.

NOTE 3: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS voice call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or other
implementation specific mechanisms (see 3GPP TS 24.173 [13E]).

The UE shall not attempt service request until expiry of timer T3325
unless:

- the service request is initiated in response to paging from the
network;

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the service request is initiated to establish a PDN connection for
emergency bearer services;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established;

- the UE is registered in a new PLMN; or

- the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user
data related to an exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use
exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of
the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file
EF_(NASCONFIG) in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

If the service request for "originating MMTEL voice" call type was
triggered while T3325 is running, a notification that the service
request was not accepted and that timer T3325 is running shall be
provided to the upper layers.

NOTE 4: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS voice call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or other
implementation specific mechanisms (see 3GPP TS 24.173 [13E]).

NOTE 5: The NAS signalling connection can also be released if the UE
deems that the network has failed the authentication check as specified
in clause 5.4.2.7.

If the UE triggered the service request procedure in order to obtain
services other than packet services from EMM-IDLE mode, then the EMM
sublayer shall abort the procedure and release locally any resources
allocated for the service request procedure.

If the UE triggered the service request procedure in EMM-CONNECTED mode,
the EMM sublayer shall abort the procedure and consider the service
request procedure with "active" flag set or the 1xCS fallback procedure
as failed. The UE shall stay in EMM-CONNECTED mode.

d) T3417ext or T3417ext-mt expired

If a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE shall
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE
finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the
appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not
indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer.
Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service
request procedure to the MM sublayer, and the UE shall also set the EPS
update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

If a CS fallback cancellation request was received the UE shall set the
EPS update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

e) SERVICE REJECT received, other EMM cause values than those treated in
clause 5.6.1.5, and cases of EMM cause values #22, #25, #31 and #78 if
considered as abnormal cases according to clause 5.6.1.5.

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback
cancellation request was not received, the UE shall attempt to select
GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN
or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific
procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the
service request procedure to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer
shall indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM
sublayer, and the UE shall also set the EPS update status to EU2 NOT
UPDATED and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback
cancellation request was received, the UE shall set the EPS update
status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall
select cdma2000^(®) 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds
with appropriate cdma2000^(®) 1x CS procedures.

If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback and the UE has
dual Rx/Tx configuration and supports enhanced 1xCS fallback, then upon
entering EMM-IDLE mode the UE shall perform tracking area updating
procedure.

If the service request was not initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback, the UE shall enter state EMM-REGISTERED.

The UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417,
T3417ext or T3417ext-mt and locally release any resources allocated for
the service request procedure.

f) Tracking area updating procedure is triggered

The UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417,
T3417ext or T3417ext-mt if running and perform the tracking area
updating procedure. The "active" flag or "signalling active" flag shall
be set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as specified in
clause 5.5.3.2.2. If the service request was initiated for CS fallback
or 1xCS fallback, and the CS fallback cancellation request was not
received, the UE shall send the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message to the
MME by using the existing NAS signalling connection after the completion
of the tracking area updating procedure. If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
ACCEPT message includes a UE radio capability ID deletion indication IE
set to "Network-assigned UE radio capability IDs deletion requested",
the UE shall not initiate a new tracking area update procedure, but
shall proceed with sending the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message by using
the existing NAS signalling connection after the completion of the
tracking area updating procedure.

g) Switch off

If the UE is in state EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED at switch off, the
detach procedure shall be performed.

h) Detach procedure collision

EPS detach containing detach type "re-attach required":

If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state
EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED, the UE shall take the following actions:

- If the service request was initiated for CS fallback, the UE shall
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE
finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the
appropriate MM, CC and GMM specific procedures and the EMM sublayer
shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM
sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the
service request procedure to the MM sublayer;

- If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall
attempt to select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology. The UE then
proceeds with appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS procedures; or

- If the service request was not initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback, the detach procedure shall be progressed and the service
request procedure shall be aborted.

EPS detach containing detach type "re-attach not required":

If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state
EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED, the UE shall take the following actions:

- If the DETACH REQUEST message contains an EMM cause other than #2
"IMSI unknown in HSS" or no EMM cause IE, the detach procedure shall be
progressed and the service request procedure shall be aborted.
Additionally, if the service request was initiated for CS fallback or
1xCS fallback, but not for CS fallback for emergency call or 1xCS
fallback for emergency call, the EMM sublayer shall indicate to the MM
sublayer or the cdma2000^(®) upper layers that the CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback procedure has failed; or

If the DETACH REQUEST message contains EMM cause #2 "IMSI unknown in
HSS", the UE will follow the procedure as described below for the detach
type "IMSI detach".

EPS detach containing detach type "IMSI detach":

If the UE receives a DETACH REQUEST message from the network in state
EMM-SERVICE-REQUEST-INITIATED, the UE shall take the following actions:

- if the service request was initiated for SMS over NAS or CS fallback,
but not for CS fallback for emergency call, the UE shall abort the
service request procedure and progress the detach procedure; or

- otherwise the UE shall progress both procedures.

i) Transmission failure of SERVICE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message indication with TAI change
from lower layers

If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the service request procedure
shall be aborted to perform the tracking area updating procedure. The
"active" flag or "signalling active" flag shall be set in the TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as specified in clause 5.5.3.2.2. If the
service request was initiated for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, and the
CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE shall send the
EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message to the MME by using the existing NAS
signalling connection after the completion of the tracking area updating
procedure.

If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the UE shall restart
the service request procedure unless the service request procedure is
initiated for case p) or q) in clause 5.6.1.1. For case p) and q) in
clause 5.6.1.1 the UE shall abort the service request procedure, enter
state EMM-REGISTERED, stop timer T3417, and locally release the NAS
signalling connection and any resources allocated for the service
request procedure.

j) Transmission failure of SERVICE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message indication without TAI
change from lower layers

The UE shall restart the service request procedure unless the service
request procedure is initiated for case p) or q) in clause 5.6.1.1. For
case p) and q) in clause 5.6.1.1 the UE shall abort the service request
procedure, enter state EMM-REGISTERED, stop timer T3417, and locally
release the NAS signalling connection and any resources allocated for
the service request procedure.

k) Default or dedicated bearer set up failure

If the lower layers indicate a failure to set up a radio bearer, the UE
shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer as described in clause 6.4.4.6.

l) "Extended wait time" from the lower layers

The UE shall abort the service request procedure, enter state
EMM-REGISTERED, and stop timer T3417, T3417ext or T3417ext-mt if still
running.

If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
signalling low priority", the UE shall start timer T3346 with the
"Extended wait time" value.

If the SERVICE REQUEST message was sent by a UE configured for NAS
signalling low priority, the UE shall start timer T3346 with the
"Extended wait time" value.

If the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message
did not contain the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
NAS signalling low priority" or if the SERVICE REQUEST message was sent
by a UE not configured for NAS signalling low priority, the UE is
operating in NB-S1 mode and the UE is not a UE configured to use AC11 –
15 in selected PLMN, then the UE shall start timer T3346 with the
"Extended wait time" value.

In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time".

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell
reselection process. The service request procedure is started, if still
necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback and a CS fallback
cancellation request was not received, the UE in CS/PS mode 1 of
operation shall attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access
technology. If the UE finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then
proceeds with the appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM
sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure
to the MM sublayer. Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort
of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer.

NOTE 5: If the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile
terminating calls could fail.

If the service request was initiated for CS fallback for emergency call
and a CS fallback cancellation request was not received, the UE may
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then
proceeds with appropriate MM and CC specific procedures. The EMM
sublayer shall not indicate the abort of the service request procedure
to the MM sublayer.

If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback, the UE shall
select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds with
appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS procedures.

If the service request was initiated for 1xCS fallback for emergency
call, the UE may select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology. The UE
then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS procedures.

If the service request was initiated due to a request from the SMS
entity to send an SMS and timer T3246 is not running, the UE, if
operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation, may select GERAN or UTRAN radio
access technology. It then proceeds with the appropriate MM procedure.

NOTE 6: If the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile
terminating calls could fail.

la) "Extended wait time CP data" from the lower layers

The UE shall abort the service request procedure for transfer of user
data via the control plane, enter state EMM-REGISTERED, and stop timer
T3417 if still running.

If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and supports the timer T3448, the
UE shall start the timer T3448 with the "Extended wait time CP data"
value. If the UE is operating in NB-S1 mode and does not support the
timer T3448, the UE shall start the timer T3346 with the "Extended wait
time CP data" value.

In other cases the UE shall ignore the "Extended wait time CP data".

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies normal cell
reselection process. The service request procedure for transfer of user
data via the control plane is started, if still necessary, when the
timer T3448 expires or is stopped.

m) Timer T3346 is running

The UE shall not start the service request procedure unless:

- the UE receives a paging;

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established
or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;

- the UE is requested by the upper layer for a CS fallback for emergency
call or a 1xCS fallback for emergency call;

- the UE has a PDN connection established without the NAS signalling low
priority indication or is establishing a PDN connection without the NAS
signalling low priority indication and if the timer T3346 was started
due to rejection of a NAS request message (e.g. ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING
AREA UPDATE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST) which contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is
configured for NAS signalling low priority";

- the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user
data related to an exceptional event and:

- the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the
ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EF_(NASCONFIG) in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]); and

- timer T3346 was not started when NAS signalling connection was
established with RRC establishment cause set to "MO exception data"; or

- the MUSIM UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode and requests the network to
release the NAS signalling connection (see case p in clause 5.6.1.1).

If the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE stays in the current serving cell
and applies normal cell reselection process. The service request
procedure is started, if still necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is
stopped.

Upon upper layer's request for a mobile originated CS fallback which is
not for emergency call, the UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation shall
attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. If the UE
finds a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, it then proceeds with the
appropriate MM and CC specific procedures and the EMM sublayer shall not
indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer.
Otherwise the EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service
request procedure to the MM sublayer.

NOTE 7: If the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile
terminating calls could fail.

Upon upper layer's request for a CS fallback for emergency call, the UE
may select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then proceeds with
appropriate MM and CC specific procedures. The EMM sublayer shall not
indicate the abort of the service request procedure to the MM sublayer.

Upon a request from the SMS entity to send an SMS and timer T3246 is not
running, the UE, if operating in CS/PS mode 1 of operation, may select
GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology. It then proceeds with the
appropriate MM procedure.

NOTE 8: If the UE disables the E-UTRA capability, then subsequent mobile
terminating calls could fail.

Upon upper layer's request for a mobile originated 1x CS fallback which
is not for emergency call, the UE shall select cdma2000® 1x radio access
technology. The UE then proceeds with appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS call
procedures.

Upon upper layer's request for a 1xCS fallback for emergency call, the
UE may select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology. The UE then proceeds
with appropriate cdma2000® 1x CS call procedures.

If the service request procedure was triggered for an MO MMTEL voice
call is started, a notification that the service request procedure was
not initiated due to congestion shall be provided to the upper layers.

NOTE 9: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
the originating voice call on an alternative manner e.g. requesting
establishment of a CS voice call (see 3GPP TS 24.173 [13E]).

n) Failure to find a suitable GERAN or UTRAN cell, after release of the
NAS signalling connection without "Extended wait time" and with
redirection indication received from lower layers when the service
request was initiated for CS fallback

The EMM sublayer shall indicate the abort of the service request
procedure to the MM sublayer, and the UE shall also set the EPS update
status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter the state
EMM-REGISTERED.ATTEMPTING-TO-UPDATE.

The UE shall abort the service request procedure, stop timer T3417ext or
T3417ext-mt and locally release any resources allocated for the service
request procedure.

o) Timer T3448 is running

The UE in EMM-IDLE mode shall not initiate the service request procedure
for transport of user data via the control plane unless:

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE which is only using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization received a paging; or

- the UE in NB-S1 mode is requested by the upper layer to transmit user
data related to an exceptional event and the UE is allowed to use
exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of
the NAS configuration MO in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file
EF_(NASCONFIG) in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process.

p) Timer T3447 is running

The UE shall not start any service request procedure unless:

- the UE receives a paging;

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established
or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or

- the MUSIM UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode and requests the network to
release the NAS signalling connection (see case p in clause 5.6.1.1).

The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell
reselection process. The service request procedure is started, if still
necessary, when timer T3447 expires.

5.6.1.7 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Lower layer failure

If a lower layer failure occurs before a SERVICE REJECT message has been
sent to the UE or the service request procedure has been completed by
the network, the network enters/stays in EMM-IDLE.

b) Protocol error

If the SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or the CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST message is received with a protocol error, the network
shall return a SERVICE REJECT message with one of the following EMM
cause values:

#96: invalid mandatory information;

#99: information element non-existent or not implemented;

#100: conditional IE error; or

#111: protocol error, unspecified.

The network stays in the current EMM mode.

c) More than one SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL
PLANE SERVICE REQUEST received before the procedure has been completed
(i.e., before SERVICE REJECT message has been sent or service request
procedure has been completed)

- If one or more of the information elements in the SERVICE REQUEST
message, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST for
packet services differs from the ones received within the previous
SERVICE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE
REQUEST message for packet services, the previously initiated service
request procedure shall be aborted and the new service request procedure
shall be progressed;

NOTE: The network actions are implementation dependent for the case that
more than one EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST messages for CS fallback or 1xCS
fallback are received and their information elements differ.

- If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall
continue with the previous service request procedure and shall not treat
any further this SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL
PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

d) ATTACH REQUEST received before a SERVICE REJECT message has been sent
or the service request procedure has been completed

If an ATTACH REQUEST message is received and the service request
procedure has not been completed or a SERVICE REJECT message has not
been sent, the network may initiate the EMM common procedures, e.g. the
EMM authentication procedure. The network may e.g. after a successful
EMM authentication procedure execution, abort the service request
procedure, delete the EMM context, EPS bearer contexts, if any, and
progress the new ATTACH REQUEST.

e) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message received before the service
request procedure has been completed or a SERVICE REJECT message has
been sent

If a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is received and the service
request procedure has not been completed or a SERVICE REJECT message has
not been sent, the network may initiate the EMM common procedures, e.g.
the EMM authentication procedure. The network may e.g. after a
successful EMM authentication procedure execution, abort the service
request procedure and progress the tracking area updating procedure.

f) Default or dedicated bearer set up failure

If the lower layers indicate a failure to set up a radio or S1 bearer,
the MME shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer as described in
clause 6.4.4.6.

5.6.2 Paging procedure

5.6.2.1 General

The paging procedure is used by the network to request the establishment
or resumption of a NAS signalling connection to the UE. Another purpose
of the paging procedure is to prompt the UE to reattach if necessary as
a result of a network failure. If the UE is not attached when it
receives a paging for EPS services, the UE shall ignore the paging.

Additionally, the network can use the paging procedure to initiate the
mobile terminating CS fallback procedure or SMS or user data transfer
via the MME.

5.6.2.2 Paging for EPS services

5.6.2.2.1 Paging for EPS services through E-UTRAN using S-TMSI

5.6.2.2.1.1 General

The network shall initiate the paging procedure for EPS services using
S-TMSI with CN domain indicator set to "PS" when:

- NAS signalling messages, cdma2000^(®) signalling messages or user data
is pending to be sent to the UE;

- no NAS signalling connection exists (see example in
figure 5.6.2.2.1.1); and

- there is no paging restriction applied in the network for that paging.

If the network has downlink user data pending for a UE, the MME has
stored paging restriction of the UE and the Paging restriction type in
the stored paging restriction is set to:

a) "All paging is restricted", the network should not initiate the
paging procedure for EPS services using S-TMSI with CN domain indicator
set to "PS" for the UE;

b) "All paging is restricted except for voice service", the network
should initiate the paging procedure for EPS services using S-TMSI with
CN domain indicator set to "PS" for the UE only when:

1) the pending downlink user data for the UE is considered as voice
service related by the network;

c) "All paging is restricted except for specified PDN connection(s)",
the network should initiate the paging procedure for EPS services using
S-TMSI with CN domain indicator set to "PS" for the UE only when:

1) for PDN connection(s) that paging is not restricted based on the
stored paging restriction, the network has downlink user data pending;
or

d) "All paging is restricted except for voice service and specified PDN
connection(s)", the network should initiate the paging procedure for EPS
services using S-TMSI with CN domain indicator set to "PS" for the UE
only when:

1) the pending downlink user data for the UE is considered as voice
service related by the network; or

2) for PDN connection(s) that paging is not restricted based on the
stored paging restriction, the network has downlink user data pending.

If the network has downlink signalling pending for a UE and the MME has
stored paging restriction of the UE and the Paging restriction type in
the stored paging restriction is set to:

a) "All paging is restricted", the network should not initiate the
paging procedure for EPS services using S-TMSI with CN domain indicator
set to "PS" for the UE;

b) "All paging is restricted except for voice service", the network
should initiate the paging procedure for EPS services using S-TMSI with
CN domain indicator set to "PS" for the UE only when:

1) the pending downlink signalling for the UE is EMM signalling or ESM
signalling of the PDN connection of voice service;

c) "All paging is restricted except for specified PDN connection(s)",
the network should initiate the paging procedure for EPS services using
S-TMSI with CN domain indicator set to "PS" for the UE only when:

1) the pending downlink signalling for the UE is EMM signalling; or

2) for PDN connection(s) that paging is not restricted based on the
stored paging restriction, the network has downlink ESM signalling
pending; or

d) "All paging is restricted except for voice service and specified PDN
connection(s)", the network should initiate the paging procedure for EPS
services using S-TMSI with CN domain indicator set to "PS" for the UE
only when:

1) the pending downlink signalling for the UE is EMM signalling or ESM
signalling of the PDN connection of voice service; or

2) for PDN connection(s) that paging is not restricted based on the
stored paging restriction, the network has downlink ESM signalling
pending.

NOTE 1: If the network pages the UE due to downlink signalling pending,
the network initiates the release of the NAS signalling connection after
network-requested procedure is completed.

For the UE using eDRX, the network initiates the paging procedure when
NAS signalling messages, cdma2000^(®) signalling messages or user data
is pending to be sent to the UE within the paging time window. If NAS
signalling messages, cdma2000^(®) signalling messages or user data is
pending to be sent to the UE outside the paging time window and the eDRX
value that the network provides to the UE in the Extended DRX parameters
IE during the last attach procedure or the last tracking area updating
procedure is not all zeros (i.e. the E-UTRAN eDRX cycle length duration
is higher than 5.12 seconds), the network initiates the paging procedure
at T time ahead of the beginning of the next paging time window.

NOTE 2: T time is a short time period based on implementation. The
operator can take possible imperfections in the synchronization between
the CN and the UE into account when choosing T time.

[]

Figure 5.6.2.2.1.1: Paging procedure using S-TMSI

To initiate the procedure the EMM entity in the network requests the
lower layer to start paging (see 3GPP TS 36.300 [20],
3GPP TS 36.413 [23]) and shall start the timer:

- T3415 for this paging procedure, if the network accepted to use eDRX
for the UE and the UE does not have a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services.

- Otherwise, T3413 for this paging procedure.

If the network detects that the pending user data to be sent to the UE
is related to the voice service as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [7] and
the network decides to initiate the paging procedure based on the stored
paging restriction information, if any, the EMM entity in the network
should request the lower layer to include the Voice Service Indication
in the Paging message when the UE and the network support the paging
indication for voice services.

If the network starts timer T3415, the network shall set timer T3415 to
a value smaller than the value of timer T3-RESPONSE (see
3GPP TS 29.274 [16D] for further details on timer T3-RESPONSE).

The EMM entity may provide the lower layer with a list of CSG IDs,
including the CSG IDs of both the expired and the not expired
subscriptions. If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer
services established, the EMM entity in the network shall not provide
the list of CSG IDs to the lower layer.

If the negotiated UE paging probability information is available in the
EMM context of the UE, the EMM entity shall provide the lower layer with
the negotiated UE paging probability information (see
3GPP TS 36.300 [20], 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]).

Upon reception of a paging indication, if control plane CIoT EPS
optimization is not used by the UE, the UE shall stop the timer T3346,
if running, and shall initiate:

- a service request procedure to respond to the paging (see
3GPP TS 23.401 [10] and 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]); or

- a tracking area updating procedure as specified in clauses 5.5.3.2.2
and 5.5.3.3.2.

and additionally if the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode with suspend
indication, resume the suspended NAS signalling connection to the MME as
specified in clause 5.3.1.3.

Upon reception of a paging indication, if control plane CIoT EPS
optimization is used by the UE, the UE shall stop the timer T3346, if
running, and shall additionally:

- initiate a service request procedure as specified in clause 5.6.1.2.2
if the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication;

- initiate a tracking area updating procedure as specified in
clauses 5.5.3.2.2; or

- proceed the behaviour as specified in clause 5.3.1.3 if the UE is in
the EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication.

NOTE 3: If the UE is in the EMM-IDLE mode without suspend indication and
has an uplink user data to be sent to the network using control plane
CIoT EPS optimization when receiving the paging indication, the UE can
piggyback the uplink user data during the service request procedure
initiated to respond to the paging, as specified in clause 5.6.1.2.2.

Upon reception of a paging indication, if the network supports the
reject paging request and the MUSIM UE decides not to accept the paging,
the UE may initiate a service request procedure to reject the paging as
specified in clause 5.6.1.1.

NOTE 4: As an implementation option, the MUSIM UE is allowed to not
respond to paging based on the information available in the paging
message, e.g. voice service indication.

If the paging for EPS services was received during an ongoing
UE-initiated EMM specific procedure or service request procedure, then
the UE shall ignore the paging. The network shall proceed with the EMM
specific procedure or the service request procedure, and stop the timer
for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415). If
the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message when the paging procedure
is ongoing, it should be considered as an abnormal case, and the
behaviour of the network for this case is specified in
clause 5.6.2.2.1.2.

The network shall stop the timer for the paging procedure (i.e. either
timer T3413 or timer T3415) when an integrity-protected response is
received from the UE and successfully integrity checked by the network
or when the EMM entity in the MME receives an indication from the lower
layer that it has received the S1-AP UE context resume request message
as specified in 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]. If the response received is not
integrity protected, or the integrity check is unsuccessful, the timer
for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415) shall
be kept running unless:

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services; or

- the response received is a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and
the security mode control procedure or authentication procedure
performed during tracking area updating procedure has completed
successfully.

Upon expiry of timer T3413, the network may reinitiate paging.

If the network, while waiting for a response to the paging sent without
paging priority, receives downlink signalling or downlink data
associated with priority EPS bearers, the network shall stop the timer
for the paging procedure (i.e. either timer T3413 or timer T3415), and
then initiate the paging procedure with paging priority.

Upon expiry of timer T3415, the network shall abort the paging procedure
and shall proceed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

5.6.2.2.1.2 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) ATTACH REQUEST message received when paging procedure is ongoing.

If an integrity-protected ATTACH REQUEST message is received from the UE
and successfully integrity checked by the network, the network shall
abort the paging procedure. If the ATTACH REQUEST message received is
not integrity protected, or the integrity check is unsuccessful, the
paging procedure shall be progressed. The paging procedure shall be
aborted when the EPS authentication procedure performed during attach
procedure is completed successfully.

5.6.2.2.1.3 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) The paging indication received for a UE that is attached for access
to RLOS

A UE attached for access to RLOS shall ignore the paging indication from
the network.

b) The paging indication received when UE-initiated EMM specific
procedure or service request procedure is ongoing.

The UE shall ignore the paging indication from the network.

5.6.2.2.2 Paging for EPS services through E-UTRAN using IMSI

Paging for EPS services using IMSI is an abnormal procedure used for
error recovery in the network.

The network may initiate paging for EPS services using IMSI with CN
domain indicator set to "PS" if the S-TMSI is not available due to a
network failure (see example in figure 5.6.2.2.2.1).

[]

Figure 5.6.2.2.2.1: Paging procedure using IMSI

In S1 mode, to initiate the procedure the EMM entity in the network
requests the lower layer to start paging. If the TAI list is not
available due to a network failure, the network may perform the paging
within all tracking areas served by the MME (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22] and
3GPP TS 36.413 [23]).

When a UE receives a paging for EPS services using IMSI from the network
before a UE initiated EMM specific procedure has been completed, then
the UE shall abort the EMM specific procedure and proceed according to
the description in this clause.

Upon reception of a paging for EPS services using IMSI, the UE shall
stop timer T3346, if it is running, locally deactivate any EPS bearer
context(s), if any, and locally detach from EPS. Additionally the UE
shall delete the following parameters: last visited registered TAI, TAI
list, GUTI and KSI_(ASME). The UE shall set the EPS update status to EU2
NOT UPDATED and change the state to EMM-DEREGISTERED. The UE shall stop
all timers T3396 that are running.

If A/Gb mode or Iu mode is supported by the UE, the UE shall in addition
handle the GMM parameters GMM state, GPRS update status, P-TMSI, P-TMSI
signature, RAI, and GPRS ciphering key sequence number as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] for the case when a paging for GPRS services using
IMSI is received.

After performing the local detach, the UE shall then perform an attach
procedure as described in clause 5.5.1.2. If the UE is operating in
CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2 of operation, then the UE shall perform a
combined attach procedure as described in clause 5.5.1.3. For this
attach procedure and its reattempts, if any, the MS shall ignore the
contents of the list of "forbidden tracking areas for roaming", as well
as the list of "forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of
service".

NOTE 1: In some cases, user interaction can be required, thus the UE
cannot activate the dedicated bearer context(s), if any, automatically.

NOTE 2: The UE does not respond to the paging except with the ATTACH
REQUEST message, hence timers T3413 and T3415 in the network are not
used when paging with IMSI.

5.6.2.3 Paging for CS fallback to A/Gb or Iu mode

5.6.2.3.1 General

The network may initiate the paging procedure for CS fallback when the
UE is IMSI attached for non-EPS services (see example in
figure 5.6.2.3.1.1).

The network should not initiate the paging procedure for CS fallback for
a UE if the MME has stored paging restriction of the UE and the Paging
restriction type in the stored paging restriction preferences is set to:

a) "All paging is restricted"; or

b) "All paging is restricted except for specified PDN connection(s)".

[]

Figure 5.6.2.3.1.1: Paging procedure for CS fallback to A/Gb or Iu mode

To initiate the procedure when no NAS signalling connection exists and
no paging restriction applied in the network for that paging, the EMM
entity in the network requests the lower layer to start paging (see
3GPP TS 36.300 [20], 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]). The EMM entity may provide
the lower layer with a list of CSG IDs, including the CSG IDs of both
the expired and the not expired subscriptions. If there is a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services established, the EMM entity in
the network shall not provide the list of CSG IDs to the lower layer.
The paging message includes a UE Paging Identity set to either the UE's
S-TMSI or the UE's IMSI, and a CN domain indicator set to "CS" in order
to indicate that this is paging for CS fallback.

NOTE: The timers T3413 and T3415 are not started in the network when the
paging procedure is initiated for CS fallback.

To notify the UE about an incoming mobile terminating CS service
excluding SMS over SGs when a NAS signalling connection exists, the EMM
entity in the network shall send a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message. This
message may also include CS service related parameters (e.g. Calling
Line Identification, SS or LCS related parameters).

Upon reception of a paging indication, a UE that is IMSI attached for
non-EPS services shall initiate a service request procedure or combined
tracking area updating procedure as specified in clause 5.5.3.3.2. If
the paging is received in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE shall respond
immediately.

Upon reception of a paging indication, if the network supports the
reject paging request feature and the MUSIM UE decides not to accept the
paging the UE may initiate a service request procedure to reject the
paging as specified in clause 5.6.1.1.

If the paging is received as a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message in
EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE may request upper layers input i.e. to accept
or reject CS fallback before responding with an EXTENDED SERVICE
REQUEST. The response is indicated in the CSFB response information
element in the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message in both EMM-IDLE and
EMM-CONNECTED modes.

5.6.2.3.2 Abnormal cases in the UE

A UE that requested "SMS only" in the combined attach procedure or
combined tracking area updating procedure may ignore the CS SERVICE
NOTIFICATION message or the paging indication with the CN domain
indicator set to "CS".

5.6.2.3.3 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) Void

b) ATTACH REQUEST message received when paging procedure is ongoing.

If an integrity-protected ATTACH REQUEST message is received from the UE
and successfully integrity checked by the network, the network shall
abort the paging procedure. If the ATTACH REQUEST message received is
not integrity protected, or the integrity check is unsuccessful, the
paging procedure shall be progressed. The paging procedure shall be
aborted when the EPS authentication procedure performed during attach
procedure is completed successfully.

c) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message received in response to a CS
SERVICE NOTIFICATION message

If the network receives a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message in
response to a CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message, the network shall
progress the tracking area updating procedure.

NOTE: After completion of the tracking area updating procedure the UE
can accept or reject the CS fallback by sending an EXTENDED SERVICE
REQUEST message.

d) DETACH REQUEST message received in response to a CS SERVICE
NOTIFICATION message

If the network receives a DETACH REQUEST message with detach type "IMSI
detach" or "combined EPS/IMSI detach" in response to a CS SERVICE
NOTIFICATION message, the network shall progress the detach procedure.

5.6.2.4 Paging for SMS

The network shall initiate the paging procedure when it receives an
incoming mobile terminating SMS to the UE if

the UE is:

1) IMSI attached for non-EPS services or for "SMS only"; or

2) attached for EPS services with CIoT EPS optimization and the UE has
requested "SMS only" and the UE is in NB-S1 mode,

- no NAS signalling connection exists.

- there is no paging restriction applied in the network.

For the UE using eDRX, the network initiates the paging procedure when
an incoming mobile terminating SMS is received within the paging time
window. If an incoming mobile terminating SMS is received outside the
paging time window and the eDRX value that the network provides to the
UE in the Extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach procedure or
the last tracking area updating procedure is not all zeros (i.e. the
E-UTRAN eDRX cycle length duration is higher than 5.12 seconds), the
network initiates the paging procedure at T time ahead of the beginning
of the next paging time window.

NOTE: T time is a short time period based on implementation. The
operator can take possible imperfections in the synchronization between
the CN and the UE into account when choosing T time.

To initiate the procedure for SMS when no NAS signalling connection
exists, the EMM entity in the network requests the lower layer to start
paging (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]). The paging message shall include a CN
domain indicator set to "PS". If the paging message includes a UE Paging
Identity set to the UE's S-TMSI, the paging procedure is performed
according to clause 5.6.2.2.1. If the paging message includes a UE
Paging Identity set to the UE's IMSI, the paging procedure is performed
according to clause 5.6.2.2.2. The MME shall not start timers T3413 and
T3415 for this procedure.

If the negotiated UE paging probability information is available in the
EMM context of the UE, the EMM entity shall provide the lower layer with
the negotiated UE paging probability information (see
3GPP TS 36.300 [20], 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]).

5.6.3 Transport of NAS messages procedure

5.6.3.1 General

The purpose of the transport of NAS messages procedure is to carry SMS
messages in an encapsulated form between the MME and the UE. The
procedure may be initiated by the UE or the network and can only be used
when the UE is attached for EPS services and non-EPS services or for EPS
services and "SMS only", and the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode.

NOTE 1: If the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode and is using EPS services with
control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the UE transports the first SMS
message by encapsulating it in the NAS message container IE in the
Control Plane Service Request message.

NOTE 2: When the UE is using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the network can initiate downlink transport of NAS
messages procedure even if the UE does not have any PDN connections
established.

5.6.3.2 UE initiated transport of NAS messages

Upon request from the SMS entity to send an SMS message, the EMM entity
in the UE initiates the procedure by sending an UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message including the SMS message in the NAS message container IE.

NOTE: When the UE is using for EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the UE can initiate uplink transport of NAS messages
procedure even if the UE does not any PDN connections established.

5.6.3.3 Network initiated transport of NAS messages

The network initiates the procedure by sending a DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message. When receiving the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message, the EMM
entity in the UE shall forward the contents of the NAS message container
IE to the SMS entity.

NOTE: When the UE is using for EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS
optimization, the network can initiate downlink transport of NAS
messages procedure even if the UE does not any PDN connections
established.

5.6.3.4 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) Timer T3346 is running

The UE shall not send an UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message unless:

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established;
or

- the UE is configured for dual priority and has a PDN connection
established without low access priority but the timer T3346 was started
in response to NAS signalling request with low access priority.

The UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still necessary, when
timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

b) Timer T3447 is running

The UE shall not send an UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message when the UE is in
EMM-CONNECTED mode after the UE attached without PDN connection, unless:

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in the selected PLMN; or

- a network initiated signalling message has been received.

The UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still necessary, when
timer T3447 expires.

5.6.3.5 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU

If the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message is not delivered for any reason,
the MME may discard the message.

b) UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT message received from a UE which is in a
location where the PLMN is not allowed to operate

If the MME determines that the UE is in a location where the PLMN is not
allowed to operate, the MME discards the message.

5.6.4 Generic transport of NAS messages procedure

5.6.4.1 General

The purpose of the generic transport of NAS messages procedure is to
carry protocol messages from various applications (e.g., an LCS
application to send an LPP message or a location service message) in an
encapsulated form between the MME and the UE. The procedure may be
initiated by the UE or the network and can only be used when the UE is
attached for EPS services and is in EMM-CONNECTED mode.

5.6.4.2 UE initiated generic transport of NAS messages

Upon request from an application to send a message encapsulated in the
generic transport of NAS message, the EMM entity in the UE initiates the
procedure by sending an UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message including
the corresponding message in the generic message container IE. The
application may also request additional information to be included in
the UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message in the Additional information
IE. The content, coding and interpretation of this information element
are dependent on the particular application.

The UE shall indicate the application protocol using the generic
transport in the corresponding generic message container type. When
receiving the UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message, the EMM entity in
the MME shall provide the contents of the generic message container IE
and the generic message container type IE to the corresponding
application. If included, the EMM entity in the MME shall also provide
the contents of the Additional information IE.

5.6.4.3 Network initiated transport of NAS messages

Upon request from an application to send a message encapsulated in the
generic transport of NAS message, the EMM entity in the MME initiates
the procedure by sending a DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message
including the corresponding message in the generic message container IE.
The application may also request additional information to be included
in the DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message in the Additional
information IE. The content, coding and interpretation of this
information element are dependent on the particular application.

The MME shall indicate the application protocol using the generic
transport in the corresponding generic message container type. When
receiving the DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message, the EMM entity in
the UE shall provide the contents of the generic message container IE
and the generic message container type IE to the corresponding
application. If included, the EMM entity in the UE shall also provide
the contents of the Additional information IE.

5.6.4.4 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) Timer T3346 is running

The UE shall not send an UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message unless:

the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established;
or

the UE is configured for dual priority and has a PDN connection
established without low access priority but the timer T3346 was started
in response to NAS signalling request with low access priority.

The UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still
necessary, when timer T3346 expires or is stopped.

b) Timer T3447 is running

The UE shall not send an UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message when the
UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode, unless:

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in the selected PLMN;

- the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established;
or

- a network initiated signalling message has been received.

The UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still
necessary, when timer T3447 expires.

5.6.4.5 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU

If the DOWNLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message is not delivered for any
reason, the MME may discard the message.

b) UPLINK GENERIC NAS TRANSPORT message received from a UE which is in a
location where the PLMN is not allowed to operate

If the MME determines that the UE is in a location where the PLMN is not
allowed to operate, the MME discards the message.

5.7 Reception of an EMM STATUS message by an EMM entity

The purpose of the sending of the EMM STATUS message is to report at any
time certain error conditions detected upon receipt of EMM protocol
data. The EMM STATUS message can be sent by both the MME and the UE (see
example in figure 5.7.1).

On receipt of an EMM STATUS message no state transition and no specific
action shall be taken as seen from the radio interface, i.e. local
actions are possible. The local actions to be taken by the MME or the UE
on receipt of an EMM STATUS message are implementation dependent.

6 Elementary procedures for EPS session management

6.1 Overview

6.1.1 General

This clause describes the procedures used for EPS session management
(ESM) at the radio interface (reference point "LTE-Uu").

The main function of the ESM sublayer is to support the EPS bearer
context handling in the UE and in the MME.

The ESM comprises procedures for:

- the activation, deactivation and modification of EPS bearer contexts;

- the request for resources (IP connectivity to a PDN or dedicated
bearer resources) by the UE; and

- the transport of user data via the control plane between the UE and
the MME.

Each EPS bearer context represents an EPS bearer between the UE and a
PDN. EPS bearer contexts can remain activated even if the radio and S1
bearers constituting the corresponding EPS bearers between UE and MME
are temporarily released.

An EPS bearer context can be either a default bearer context or a
dedicated bearer context.

A default EPS bearer context is activated when the UE requests a
connection to a PDN.

Generally, ESM procedures can be performed only if an EMM context has
been established between the UE and the MME, and the secure exchange of
NAS messages has been initiated by the MME by use of the EMM procedures
described in clause 5. The first default EPS bearer context, however,
can be activated during the EPS attach procedure (see clause 4.2). Once
the UE is successfully attached, and the first default EPS bearer
context has been activated during or after the attach procedure, the UE
can request the MME to set up connections to additional PDNs. For each
additional connection, the MME will activate a separate default EPS
bearer context. A default EPS bearer context remains activated
throughout the lifetime of the connection to the PDN.

A dedicated EPS bearer context is always linked to a default EPS bearer
context and represents additional EPS bearer resources between the UE
and the PDN. The network can initiate the activation of dedicated EPS
bearer contexts together with the activation of the default EPS bearer
context or at any time later, as long as the default EPS bearer context
remains activated. However, the network shall not initiate a dedicated
bearer context activation procedure for established PDN connection(s) of
"non IP" PDN type.

Default and dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be modified. Dedicated EPS
bearer contexts can be released without affecting the default EPS bearer
context. When the default EPS bearer context is released, then all
dedicated EPS bearer contexts linked to it are released too.

The UE can request the network to allocate, modify or release EPS bearer
resources. The network can fulfil such a request from the UE by
activating a new dedicated EPS bearer context, modifying an EPS bearer
context or deactivating an EPS bearer context.

6.1.2 Types of ESM procedures

Two types of ESM procedures can be distinguished:

1) Procedures related to EPS bearer contexts:

These procedures are initiated by the network and are used for the
manipulation of EPS bearer contexts:

- default EPS bearer context activation;

- dedicated EPS bearer context activation;

- EPS bearer context modification;

- EPS bearer context deactivation.

This procedure is initiated by the network or by the UE and is used for
the transport of user data via the control plane:

- transport of user data via the control plane procedure.

2) Transaction related procedures:

These procedures are initiated by the UE to request for resources, i.e.
a new PDN connection or dedicated bearer resources, or to release these
resources:

- PDN connectivity procedure;

- PDN disconnect procedure;

- bearer resource allocation procedure;

- bearer resource modification procedure.

This procedure is initiated by the ProSe UE-to-network relay and is used
for the manipulation of EPS bearer contexts:

- remote UE report.

When combined with the attach procedure, the PDN connectivity procedure
can trigger the network to execute the following transaction related
procedure:

- ESM information request procedure.

When combined with the attach procedure, if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection is supported by the UE and the network and no PDN
connectivity procedure is initiated during the attach procedure, the UE
or the network executes the following transaction related procedure:

- ESM dummy message procedure.

A successful transaction related procedure initiated by the UE triggers
the network to execute one of the procedures related to EPS bearer
contexts. The UE treats the start of the procedure related to the EPS
bearer context as completion of the transaction related procedure.

During procedures related to EPS bearer contexts, the MME and the UE
shall not initiate the transport of user data via the control plane
procedure until the ongoing procedure is completed.

NOTE 1: The UE determination of the completion of the transport of user
data via the control plane procedure is left to the implementation.

NOTE 2: NAS signalling prioritization with respect to the transport of
user data via the control plane cannot be guaranteed in the downlink
direction in this version of the specification.

Except for the remote UE report procedure and ESM information request
procedure, during transaction related procedures, the MME and the UE
shall not initiate the transport of user data via the control plane
procedure until the ongoing procedure is completed.

The following ESM procedures can be related to an EPS bearer context or
to a procedure transaction:

- ESM status procedure;

- notification procedure.

6.1.3 ESM sublayer states

6.1.4 Coordination between ESM and SM

For inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode, SM uses
the following parameters from each active EPS bearer context:

- EPS bearer identity to map to NSAPI;

NOTE 1: If the UE and the MME support signalling for a maximum number of
15 EPS bearer contexts, any active EPS bearer contexts using EPS bearer
identity 1 to 4 are not mapped but deactivated locally before
inter-system change to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.

- linked EPS bearer identity (if available) to map to linked TI;

- PDN address and APN of the default EPS bearer context to map to PDP
address and APN of the default PDP context;

- TFT of the default EPS bearer context, if any, to map to the TFT of
the default PDP context;

- TFTs of the dedicated EPS bearer contexts to map to TFTs of the
secondary PDP contexts; and

- GERAN/UTRAN parameters as provided by the MME while on E-UTRAN access,
i.e. R99 QoS, LLC SAPI, radio priority, packet flow identifier,
transaction identifier and BCM (if available). If the MME also provided
an Extended EPS QoS IE, then the bit rates signalled with this IE are
also applicable to the R99 QoS.

NOTE 2: Some networks not supporting mobility from S1 mode to A/Gb mode
or Iu mode or both do not provide the UE with the GERAN/UTRAN
parameters. However, for this case there is no need for the UE to
perform mapping to GERAN/UTRAN parameters (i.e. the PDP contexts cannot
be transferred to A/Gb mode or Iu mode).

The MME performs the mapping from EPS to R99 QoS parameters according to
3GPP TS 23.401 [10], annex E.

At inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode, SM shall not activate
the PDP context(s) if SM does not have the following parameters from the
active EPS bearer context(s):

- LLC SAPI;

- radio priority;

- transaction identifier; and

- R99 QoS.

At inter-system change from S1 mode to Iu mode, SM shall not activate
the PDP context(s) if SM does not have the following parameter from the
active EPS bearer context(s):

- transaction identifier; and

- R99 QoS.

For inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, ESM uses
the following parameters from each active PDP context:

- NSAPI to map to EPS bearer identity;

- NSAPI of the default PDP context to map to linked EPS bearer identity;

- PDP address and APN of the default PDP context to map to PDN address
and APN of the default EPS bearer context;

- TFT of the default PDP context, if any, to map to the TFT of the
default EPS bearer context; and

- TFTs of the secondary PDP contexts to map to the TFTs of the dedicated
EPS bearer contexts.

The MME and the UE perform the mapping from R99 to EPS QoS parameters
according to 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], annex E. In particular the MME derives
the APN-AMBR for the corresponding PDN connection from the MBR of the
R99 subscribed QoS profile and the UE maps the MBR of its default PDP
context to the APN-AMBR of the corresponding PDN connection.

6.1.4A Coordination between ESM and 5GSM

See clause 6.1.4 in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

6.1.5 Coordination between ESM and EMM for supporting ISR

The UE with its TIN set as "RAT‑related TMSI" for which ISR is activated
shall change its TIN to "GUTI" to locally deactivate ISR and stop the
periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running:

- upon modification of any EPS bearer context which was activated before
the ISR is activated in the UE;

- at the time when the UE changes from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode
not due to PS handover procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]), if any EPS
bearer context activated after the ISR was activated in the UE exists;
or

- upon deactivation of the last non-emergency EPS bearer context in the
UE, if the UE has only a PDN connection for emergency bearer services
remaining.

ISR remains activated on the network side in the above cases.

6.2 IP address allocation

6.2.1 General

The UE can configure an IPv4 address during the establishment of a
default EPS bearer context. The UE can obtain an IPv4 address or an IPv6
prefix or both via an IETF-based IP address allocation mechanism once
the default bearer is established.

The following IETF-based IP address/prefix allocation methods are
specified for EPS (the corresponding procedures are specified in
3GPP TS 29.061 [16]):

a) /64 IPv6 default prefix allocation via IPv6 stateless address
autoconfiguration. Optionally, allocation of additional IPv6 prefix(es)
with length /64 or shorter via stateful DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (see
IETF RFC 3633 [24A]);

b) IPv4 address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration via DHCPv4;

c) IPv6 parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv6.

NOTE: From the perspective of the UE, the procedure used to allocate a
static IP address via NAS signalling is the same as the procedure used
to allocate a dynamic IP address specified in clause 6.2.2.

Upon deactivation of the default bearer of a PDN connection, the UE
shall locally release any IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix allocated to the
UE for the corresponding PDN connection.

6.2.2 IP address allocation via NAS signalling

The UE shall set the PDN type IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message, based on its IP stack configuration if it requests IP
connectivity (e.g. the per APN settings specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]) as follows:

a)- A UE, which is IPv6 and IPv4 capable and

- has not been allocated an IP address for this APN, shall set the PDN
type IE to IPv4v6.

- has been allocated an IPv4 address for this APN and received the ESM
cause #52 "single address bearers only allowed", and is requesting an
IPv6 address, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv6.

- has been allocated an IPv6 address for this APN and received the ESM
cause #52 "single address bearers only allowed", and is requesting an
IPv4 address, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv4.

b) A UE, which is only IPv4 capable, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv4.

c) A UE, which is only IPv6 capable, shall set the PDN type IE to IPv6.

d) When the IP version capability of the UE is unknown in the UE (as in
the case when the MT and TE are separated and the capability of the TE
is not known in the MT), the UE shall set the PDN type IE to IPv4v6.

If the UE wants to use DHCPv4 for IPv4 address assignment, it shall
indicate that to the network within the Protocol configuration options
IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST.

If the UE wants to get PDN connectivity for non-IP, the UE shall set the
PDN type IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to "non IP". If the
UE wants to get PDN connectivity for Ethernet, the UE shall set the PDN
type IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to "Ethernet".

On receipt of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message sent by the UE, the
network when allocating an IP address shall take into account the PDN
type IE, the operator policies of the home and visited network, and the
user's subscription data and:

- if the UE requests for PDN type IPv4v6, but the subscription is
limited to IPv4 only or IPv6 only for the requested APN, the network
shall override the PDN type requested by the UE to be limited to a
single address PDN type (IPv4 or IPv6). In the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to the UE, the network shall set the
PDN type value to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" and the ESM cause value to #50
"PDN type IPv4 only allowed", or #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed",
respectively. The UE shall not subsequently initiate another UE
requested PDN connectivity procedure to the same APN to obtain a PDN
type different from the one allowed by the network until:

a) the UE is registered to a new PLMN;

b) void;

c) the UE is switched off; or

d) the USIM is removed.

NOTE 1: Request to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a
specific PDN type has to come from upper layers.

- if the UE requests PDN type IPv4v6, but the PDN GW configuration
dictates the use of IPv4 addressing only or IPv6 addressing only for
this APN, the network shall override the PDN type requested by the UE to
limit it to a single address PDN type (IPv4 or IPv6). In the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to the UE, the network
shall set the PDN type value to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" and the ESM
cause value to #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", or #51 "PDN type IPv6
only allowed", respectively. The UE shall not subsequently initiate
another UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to the same APN to
obtain a PDN type different from the one allowed by the network until:

a) the UE is registered to a new PLMN;

b) void;

c) the UE is switched off; or

d) the USIM is removed.

NOTE 2: Request to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a
specific PDN type has to come from upper layers.

- if the UE requests PDN type IPv4v6, but the operator uses single
addressing per bearer, e.g. due to interworking with nodes of earlier
releases, the network shall override the PDN type requested by the UE to
a single IP version only. In the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message sent to the UE, the network shall set the PDN type value
to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" and the ESM cause value to #52 "single
address bearers only allowed". The UE should subsequently request
another PDN connection for the other IP version using the UE requested
PDN connectivity procedure to the same APN with a single address PDN
type (IPv4 or IPv6) other than the one already activated;

NOTE 3: If the MT and TE are separated, the UE might not be able to use
ESM cause #52 "single address bearers only allowed" as a trigger for
activating a second single-IP-stack EPS bearer context.

- if the network sets the PDN type to IPv4 or IPv4v6, the network shall
include an IPv4 address in the PDN address information. In this case, if
the IPv4 address is to be configured using DHCPv4, the network shall set
the IPv4 address to 0.0.0.0; and

- if the network sets the PDN type to IPv6 or IPv4v6, the network shall
include the interface identifier that the UE shall use for the link
local address in the PDN address information.

The network shall include the PDN type and the PDN address information
within the PDN address IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message sent to the UE.

6.2A IP header compression

The UE and the MME may support robust header compression (ROHC)
framework (see IETF RFC 5795 [37]) for IP header compression if control
plane CIoT EPS optimization is supported for PDN connections of IP PDN
type. If IP header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization
is supported, the ROHC profiles defined in 3GPP TS 36.323 [38] may be
supported. The ROHC configuration is negotiated and established during
the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure as specified in
clause 6.5.1. Both the UE and the MME indicate whether IP header
compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization is supported during
attach and tracking area updating procedures (see clauses 5.5.1 and
5.5.3). The ROHC configuration can be re-negotiated by using the UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure or the EPS bearer
context modification procedure as specified in clauses 6.4.3 and 6.5.4.

6.3 General on elementary ESM procedures

6.3.1 Services provided by lower layers

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the procedures described in the
following clauses can only be executed whilst a NAS signalling exists
between the UE and the MME.

6.3.2 Principles of address handling for ESM procedures

Transaction related procedures use the procedure transaction identity as
address parameter in the ESM message header. When the UE or the network
initiates a transaction related procedure, it shall include a valid
procedure transaction identity value in the message header and set the
EPS bearer identity to "no EPS bearer identity assigned". When the ProSe
UE-to-network relay initiates the transaction related procedure remote
UE report, it shall include a valid procedure transaction identity value
in the message header and set the EPS bearer identity to a valid EPS
bearer identity value.

If the response message is again a transaction related message, e.g. a
PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT, PDN DISCONNECT REJECT, BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REJECT, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT, ESM INFORMATION
REQUEST message or ESM DUMMY MESSAGE from the network or an ESM
INFORMATION RESPONSE message or ESM DUMMY MESSAGE from the UE, the
sending entity shall include the procedure transaction identity value
received with the request message and set the EPS bearer identity to "no
EPS bearer identity assigned" (see examples in figures 6.3.2.1, 6.3.2.1a
and 6.3.2.2). If the response message is the transaction related message
REMOTE UE REPORT RESPONSE message from the network, the network shall
include the procedure transaction identity value received with the
request message and set the EPS bearer identity to the EPS bearer
identity value received from the ProSe UE-to-network relay (see example
in figure 6.3.2.2a).

If an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE is sent in response to a received ESM DUMMY
MESSAGE, the sending entity shall include the received procedure
transaction identity value in the message header and set the EPS bearer
identity to "no EPS bearer identity assigned".

Figure 6.3.2.2a: Transaction related procedure initiated by the UE

EPS bearer context related procedures use the EPS bearer identity as
address parameter in the ESM message header. When the network initiates
an EPS bearer context related procedure, it shall include a valid EPS
bearer identity value in the message header. The procedure transaction
identity value shall be set as follows:

- If the EPS bearer context related procedure was triggered by the
receipt of a transaction related request message from the UE, the
network shall include the procedure transaction identity value received
with the transaction related request message in the message header of
the EPS bearer context related request message (see example in
figure 6.3.2.3).

- If the procedure was triggered network-internally, the network shall
set the procedure transaction identity value in the message header of
the EPS bearer context related request message to "no procedure
transaction identity assigned" (see example in figure 6.3.2.4).

- If the procedure was triggered by the transport of user data via the
control plane, the network shall set the procedure transaction identity
value in the message header of the EPS bearer context related request
message to "no procedure transaction identity assigned" (see example in
figure 6.3.2.5).

In the response message of the EPS bearer context related procedure, the
UE shall include the EPS bearer identity value received from the network
and set the procedure transaction identity value to "no procedure
transaction identity assigned".

When the UE initiates an EPS bearer context related procedure and the
procedure was triggered by the transport of user data via the control
plane, it shall include a valid EPS bearer identity value and set the
procedure transaction identity value to "no procedure transaction
identity assigned" in the message header (see example in
figure 6.3.2.6).

6.3.3 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) ESM uplink message transmission failure indication by lower layers

Unless the procedure descriptions in clause 6.6 specify a different
behaviour, the following applies:

- If lower layers indicate a TAI change, but the current TAI is not in
the TAI list, the ESM procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated after
successfully performing a tracking area updating procedure.

- If lower layers indicate a TAI change, but the current TAI is still
part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE implementation how the ESM
procedure is re-initiated.

- If lower layers indicate the TAI has not changed, it is up to the UE
implementation how the ESM procedure is re-initiated.

NOTE 1: The ESM procedure can typically be re-initiated using a
retransmission mechanism of the uplink message (the one that has
previously failed to be transmitted) with new sequence number and
message authentication code information thus avoiding to restart the
whole procedure.

The case a) above does not apply to the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE
message.

NOTE 2: The ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message cannot be subjected to a
transmission failure by lower layers due to handover as no handover
message can be accepted by the UE prior to reception of the ATTACH
ACCEPT message (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).

b) Transmission failure of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
ACCEPT message indication from EMM sublayer when the UE received any
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST messages during the attach
procedure

It is up to the UE implementation how the dedicated EPS bearer context
activation procedure is re-initiated.

NOTE 3: The ESM procedure can typically be re-initiated using a
retransmission mechanism of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT
ACCEPT message or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message
with new sequence number and message authentication code information
thus avoiding to restart the whole procedure.

6.3.4 Abnormal cases in the network

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

Unless the procedure descriptions in clause 6.4, 6.5 or 6.6 specify a
different behaviour, the following applies:

If the downlink ESM NAS message could not be delivered due to an intra
MME handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon
successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit
the ESM message. If a failure of the handover procedure is reported by
the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall
retransmit the downlink ESM NAS message.

b) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to inter-eNodeB
connected mode mobility when the transport of user data via the control
plane is used

If the downlink ESM NAS message could not be delivered due to
inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility and the MME is not changed, then
upon successful completion of inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility the
MME shall retransmit the ESM message. If a failure of inter-eNodeB
connected mode mobility is reported by the lower layer and the S1
signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the downlink ESM
NAS message.

NOTE: If the downlink ESM NAS message could not be delivered due to
inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility and the MME is changed, the
retransmission of downlink ESM NAS message is not supported.

6.3.5 Handling of APN based congestion control

The network may detect and start performing the APN based congestion
control when one or more APN congestion criteria as specified in
3GPP TS 23.401 [10] are met. The network may store an APN congestion
back-off time on a per UE and congested APN basis. If the UE does not
provide an APN for a non-emergency PDN connection, then the MME uses the
APN which is used in PDN GW selection procedure as congested APN. When
APN based congestion control is active, the network may reject session
management requests except the modification of bearer resources requests
from UEs or disconnect existing PDN connections with ESM cause value #26
"insufficient resources".

In the UE, EPS session management timers T3396 for APN based congestion
control are started and stopped on a per APN basis. The APN associated
with T3396 is the APN provided by the UE when the PDN connection is
established. If no APN is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or,
when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message, then T3396 is
associated with no APN. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the APN
provided to the network during the PDN connection establishment. The
timer T3396 associated with no APN will never be started due to any ESM
procedure related to an emergency PDN connection. If the timer T3396
associated with no APN is running or is deactivated, it does not affect
the ability of the UE to request an emergency PDN connection.

If timer T3396 is running or is deactivated, the UE is allowed to
indicate change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status, initiate PDN
disconnection procedure, initiate bearer resource modification procedure
to release of bearer resources for the respective APN, and if the UE is
a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE is
allowed to initiate an attach procedure or any EPS session management
procedure for the respective APN.

6.3.5A Handling of group specific session management congestion control

The network may detect and start performing the group specific session
management congestion control when one or more group congestion criteria
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] are met. When group specific session
management congestion control is active, the mechanism for APN based
congestion control as specified in clause 6.3.5 shall be followed.

6.3.6 Handling of network rejection not due to APN based congestion control

The network may include a back-off timer value in an EPS session
management reject message to regulate the time interval at which the UE
may retry the same procedure. For ESM cause values other than #26
"insufficient resources", the network may also include the re-attempt
indicator to indicate whether the UE is allowed to re-attempt the
corresponding session management procedure for the same APN in A/Gb or
Iu mode or N1 mode after inter-system change.

NOTE 1: If the network includes this back-off timer value, then the UE
is blocked from sending another ESM request for the same procedure for
the same PLMN and APN combination for the specified duration. Therefore,
the operator needs to exercise caution in determining the use of this
timer value.

NOTE 2: If the re-attempt indicator is not provided by the network, a UE
registered in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present)
can use the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value specified in the NAS
configuration MO or in the USIM NAS_(CONFIG) file to derive the
re-attempt indicator as specified in clauses 6.5.1.4.3, 6.5.3.4.3, and
6.5.4.4.3.

If re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, the UE shall
consider the back-off timer to be applicable only to the EPS session
management in S1 mode for the rejected EPS session management procedure
and the given PLMN and APN combination. If re-attempt in A/Gb and Iu
mode and N1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall consider the back-off
timer to be applicable to all three NAS protocols, i.e. applicable to
the EPS session management in S1 mode for the rejected EPS session
management procedure, to the GPRS session management in A/Gb and Iu mode
for the corresponding session management procedure and the given PLMN
and APN combination and to the 5GS session management in N1 mode for the
corresponding session management procedure and the given PLMN and APN
combination.

NOTE 3: In the present clause the terms APN and DNN are referring to the
same parameter.

The APN of the PLMN and APN combination associated with the back-off
timer is the APN provided by the UE when the PDN connection is
established. If no APN is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or,
when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message, then the
back-off timer is associated with the combination of the PLMN and no
APN. For this purpose the UE shall memorize the APN provided to the
network during the PDN connection establishment. The back-off timer
associated with the combination of a PLMN with no APN will never be
started due to any ESM procedure related to an emergency PDN connection.
If the back-off timer associated with the combination of a PLMN with no
APN is running, it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an
emergency PDN connection.

The network may additionally indicate in the re-attempt indicator that a
command to back-off is applicable not only for the PLMN in which the UE
received the EPS session management reject message, but for each PLMN
included in the equivalent PLMN list at the time when the EPS session
management reject message was received.

If the back-off timer is running or is deactivated for a given PLMN and
APN combination, and the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in
selected PLMN, then the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or
any EPS session management procedure for this PLMN and APN combination.

6.3.7 Handling of WLAN offload control

In networks that support offloading of traffic to WLAN, as specified in
3GPP TS 36.331 [22], a permission to offload is determined for the UE
and the PDN connection in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]
clause 4.3.23.

6.3.8 Handling of serving PLMN rate control

Serving PLMN rate control enables the serving PLMN to protect its MME
and the signalling radio bearers in the E-UTRAN from load generated by
NAS messages with user data over control plane. The MME can inform the
UE of any local serving PLMN rate control during the default EPS bearer
context activation procedure (see clause 6.4.1). If the serving PLMN
rate control is enabled, the MME shall start the serving PLMN rate
control for the PDN connection when the first NAS message with user data
over control plane is received over the PDN connection. The UE shall
limit the rate at which it generates uplink NAS messages with user data
over control plane to comply with the serving PLMN policy provided by
the network. The indicated rate in a NAS procedure applies to the PDN
connection the NAS procedure corresponds to, and the indicated rate is
valid until the PDN connection is released.

Serving PLMN rate control is applicable for PDN connections established
for control plane CIoT EPS optimization only.

Any serving PLMN rate control information provided by the network to the
UE is only applicable for the PLMN which provided this information. This
serving PLMN rate control information shall be discarded when the UE
successfully registers to another PLMN.

NOTE: The serving PLMN can discard or delay NAS messages including user
data over control plane that exceed the limit provided for serving PLMN
rate control.

6.3.9 Handling of APN rate control

APN rate control controls the maximum number of uplink user data
messages including uplink exception data reporting sent by the UE in a
time interval for the APN in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. The UE
shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink user data messages to
comply with the APN rate control policy. The NAS shall provide the
indicated rates to upper layers for enforcement. The indicated rates in
a NAS procedure applies to the APN the NAS procedure corresponds to, and
the indicated rates are valid until a new value is indicated or the last
PDN connection using this APN is released.

If the UE supports APN rate control, the UE shall provide the support
indication of APN rate control and additional APN rate control for
exception data reporting to the network. If the UE indicates support of
additional APN rate control for exception data reporting, the network
may provide the APN rate control parameters for exception data to the
UE. If the UE does not indicate support of additional APN rate control
for exception data reporting, the network shall not provide the APN rate
control parameters for exception data to the UE.

If an allowed indication of additional exception reports is provided
with the APN rate control parameters and:

- the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data is
provided and the limit for additional rate for exception data reporting
is not reached; or

- the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data is not
provided,

the UE is allowed to send uplink exception reports even if the limit for
the APN rate control has been reached.

NOTE 1: The HPLMN can discard or delay user data that exceeds the limit
provided for APN rate control.

Upon inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE shall store the
current APN rate control status for each APN associated with PDN
connection(s) to be transferred from S1 mode to N1 mode as specified in
3GPP TS 23.501 [58].

NOTE 2: How long the UE stores the current APN rate control status is
implementation specific.

Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall use the
stored APN rate control status, if any, to comply with the APN rate
control policy for an APN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [58] if:

a) there is at least one PDN connection associated with this APN was
transferred from N1 mode to S1 mode; and

b) the validity period of the stored APN rate control status has not
expired.

After inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if all the PDU
sessions associated with the same APN that was used in S1 mode are
released, the UE shall delete the stored APN rate control status for
this APN.

6.3.10 Handling of 3GPP PS data off

A UE, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]), can be
configured with up to two lists of 3GPP PS data off exempt services as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in the EF_(3GPPPSDATAOFF) USIM file
as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]:

- a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or
EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present); and

- a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN.

If only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the
HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) is configured at the UE,
this list shall be also used in the VPLMN.

If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, the UE shall provide the 3GPP PS
data off UE status in the Protocol configuration options IE during
attach, UE-requested PDN connectivity, and UE-requested bearer resource
modification procedure (see clause 5.5.1, 6.5.1, and 6.5.4).

NOTE 1: The sending of the 3GPP PS data off UE status to the network
happens also when the user activates or deactivates 3GPP PS data off
while connected via WLAN access only, and then handover to 3GPP access
occur.

The network informs the UE about the support of 3GPP PS data off during
the activation of the default bearer of a PDN connection (see
clause 6.4.1). If 3GPP PS data off support is not indicated in the
Protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall not indicate any change of 3GPP PS
data off UE status for the PDN connection established by the default EPS
bearer context activation procedure; otherwise the UE shall indicate
change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status for the PDN connection by using
the UE-requested bearer resource modification procedure as specified in
clause 6.5.4. If the network does not provide indication of support of
3GPP PS data off during default EPS bearer context activation procedure
of the PDN connection, the UE behaviour for non-exempt service requests
from the network is implementation dependent.

When the 3GPP PS data off UE status is "activated":

a) the UE does not send uplink IP packets except:

- for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is
present) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] when the UE is in its
HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present);

- for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is
present) when the UE is in the VPLMN, if only the list of 3GPP PS data
off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN
list is present) is configured to the UE as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A];

- for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt
services to be used in the VPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN, if the
list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN is
configured to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A];

- for those services indicated in the EF_(3GPPPSDATAOFF) USIM file as
specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17];

- any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D]; and

- any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.623 [50];
and

b) the UE does not send uplink non-IP or Ethernet user data packets.

Otherwise the UE sends uplink user data packets without restriction.

NOTE 2: If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, uplink IP packets are
filtered as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] in L.3.1.5.

6.3.11 Handling of Reliable Data Service

If the UE supports Reliable Data Service (see 3GPP TS 24.250 [51]), the
UE may request data transfer using Reliable Data Service for a PDN
connection in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during
attach and UE-requested PDN connectivity procedures (see clause 5.5.1
and 6.5.1).

The Reliable Data Service may only be used with PDN connections for
which the "Control plane only" indicator is set or with PDN connections
using the control plane CIoT EPS optimization when the MME does not move
such PDN connections to the user plane.

The SCEF or P-GW shall inform the UE about the acceptance of UE's
request for Reliable Data Service usage during the activation of the
default bearer of a PDN connection (see clause 6.4.1) in the Extended
protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message.

If the SCEF or P-GW accepts the use of Reliable Data Service to transfer
data for the specified PDN connection, the UE shall use this PDN
connection exclusively for data transfer using Reliable Data Service;
otherwise the UE shall not use this PDN connection for data transfer
using Reliable Data Service.

6.3.12 Handling of Ethernet PDN type

A UE may support the Ethernet PDN type. A network may support the
Ethernet PDN type.

6.3.13 Handling of Uncrewed aerial vehicle identification, authentication, and authorization

6.3.13.1 General

An EPS can support uncrewed aerial vehicle identification,
authentication, and authorization (see 3GPP TS 23.256 [60]).

Before accessing EPS for UAS services, the UE supporting UAS services
must have an assigned CAA-level UAV ID.

6.3.13.2 Authentication and authorization of UAV

The UE supporting UAS services may request a PDN connection for USS
communication during attach and UE-requested PDN connectivity procedures
(see clause 5.5.1 and 6.5.1). In the request of the PDN connection for
USS communication, the UE provides CAA-level UAV ID to the network via
the protocol configuration options and the network may decide to perform
UUAA-SM procedure. If provided by the upper layers, a UE supporting UAS
services may provide to the network the USS address via the protocol
configuration options during attach and UE-requested PDN connectivity
procedures so that the network may use the information to discover the
USS.

After successful UUAA-SM procedure, the network may initiate the
re-authentication or re-authorization procedure for the UE supporting
UAS services as a part of network-initiated EPS bearer context
modification procedure. If UUAA-SM fails during the re-authentication or
a re-authorization procedure, or if the revocation of UUAA is initiated
by the network, then the associated PDN connection for USS communication
is released.

6.3.13.3 Authorization of C2 communication

The network supports C2 communication authorization for pairing of UAV
and UAV-C. The pairing of UAV and UAV-C needs to be authorized by USS
successfully before the user plane connectivity for C2 communication
(over Uu or over NR-PC5) is enabled. The UE supporting UAS services may
provide the network with an identification information of UAV-C to pair
with, if available, via the protocol configuration options as follows:

- If the UE uses a common PDN connectivity for both USS communication
and C2 communication with a UAV-C, the C2 communication with the UAV-C
can be authorized using UUAA-SM procedure during the PDN connectivity
procedure or during the bearer resource modification procedure. If the
pairing of UAV and UAV-C is revoked, the network shall disable C2
communication for the PDN connection.

NOTE 1: The network can disable C2 communication for the PDN connection
e.g., by removing the packet filter(s) allocated for C2 communication
during EPS bearer context modification procedure as specified in
clause 6.4.3 or by deactivating the EPS bearer context for C2
communication during EPS bearer context deactivation procedure as
specified in clause 6.4.4.

- If the UE uses separate PDN connectivity for, respectively, USS
communication and C2 communication with a UAV-C, the C2 communication
with the UAV-C is authorized using UUAA-SM during the PDN connectivity
procedure. If the pairing of UAV and UAV-C is revoked, the PDN
connectivity or C2 communication shall be released by the network.

The authorization of direct C2 communication can be performed during the
C2 communication authorization procedure.

NOTE 2: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload,
sent to the network via the protocol configuration options, can include
an indication of the request for direct C2 communication and pairing
information for direct C2 communication (see subclauses 6.4.3.3 and
6.5.1.2).

The authorization of UAV flight can also be performed during the C2
communication authorization procedure. The UE supporting UAS services
provides flight authorization information to the network via the
protocol configuration options if the flight authorization information
is already available in the UE.

6.3.13.4 Void

Void.

6.3.14 Handling of URSP provisioning

The UE can perform the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to
transport the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] from the UE to the network and a related URSP
provisioning in EPS support indicator from the network to the UE. The
successful exchange of the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicators,
if the extended protocol configuration options is supported by the
network and the UE end-to-end for the PDN connection as specified in
subclause 6.6.1.1, enables the UE to thereafter perform the UE requested
bearer resource modification procedure to transport a UE policy
container with the length of two octets as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] from the UE to the network to transfer the UE STATE
INDICATION message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] annex D.

Thereafter, the network can initiate the EPS bearer context modification
procedure or the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure to
transport UE policy container with the length of two octets as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] from the network to the UE. The UE can transport
UE policy container with the length of two octets from the UE to the
network using the EPS bearer context modification procedure or the
dedicated EPS context activation procedure. The UE policy container with
the length of two octets enable the transfer of the messages specified
in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] annex D.

If the UE while in N1 mode has indicated support for URSP provisioning
in EPS as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] annex D, the UE performs
inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE has not yet provided
a UE policy container with the length of two octets to the network as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] during the dedicated EPS bearer context
activation procedure, or EPS bearer context modification procedure, then
the network can send a UE policy container with the length of two octets
to the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] during the dedicated EPS
bearer context activation procedure, or EPS bearer context modification
procedure on any PDN connection.

6.4 Network initiated ESM procedures

6.4.1 Default EPS bearer context activation procedure

6.4.1.1 General

The purpose of the default bearer context activation procedure is to
establish a default EPS bearer context between the UE and the EPC. The
default EPS bearer context activation procedure is initiated by the
network as a response to the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message from the
UE. The default bearer context activation procedure can be part of the
attach procedure, and if the attach procedure fails, the UE shall
consider that the default bearer activation has implicitly failed. The
default EPS bearer context does not have any TFT assigned during the
activation procedure. This corresponds to using a match-all packet
filter. The network may at any time after the establishment of this
bearer assign a TFT to the default EPS bearer and may subsequently
modify the TFT or the packet filters of this default bearer.

6.4.1.2 Default EPS bearer context activation initiated by the network

The MME shall initiate the default bearer context activation procedure
by sending an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and
enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE PENDING (see example in
figure 6.4.1.2.1). When the default bearer is activated as part of the
attach procedure, the MME shall send the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message together with ATTACH ACCEPT and shall not start
the timer T3485. When the default bearer is activated as the response to
a stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message apart from the attach
procedure, the MME shall send the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message alone, and start the timer T3485.

The MME shall assign and include an EPS bearer identity in the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message selecting a value as
specified by clause 9.3.2. The MME shall retrieve the PTI from the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and include it in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. Both the network identifier part and the
operator identifier part shall be included in the Access Point Name IE.

[]

Figure 6.4.1.2.1: Default EPS bearer context activation procedure

6.4.1.3 Default EPS bearer context activation accepted by the UE

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
if the UE provided an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection,
the UE shall stop timer T3396 if it is running for the APN provided by
the UE. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the
PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and
from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the
timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. If the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received in response to a
request for an emergency PDN connection, the UE shall not stop the timer
T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. For any case, the UE
shall then send an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message
and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE. When the default bearer is
activated as part of the attach procedure, the UE shall send the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message together with ATTACH
COMPLETE message. When the default bearer is activated as the response
to the stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the UE shall send
the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message alone.

If a WLAN offload indication information element is included in the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store
the WLAN offload acceptability values for this PDN connection and use
the E-UTRAN offload acceptability value to determine whether this PDN
connection is offloadable to WLAN or not.

The UE checks the PTI in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message to identify the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to which
the default bearer context activation is related (see clause 6.5.1).

If the UE receives a serving PLMN rate control IE in the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the
serving PLMN rate control IE value and use the stored serving PLMN rate
control value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink User data container
IEs included in ESM DATA TRANSPORT messages for the corresponding PDN
connection in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10].

If the UE receives an APN rate control parameters container in the
Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration
options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
the UE shall store the APN rate control parameters value and use the
stored APN rate control parameters value as the maximum allowed limit of
uplink user data related to the APN indicated in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message in accordance with
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has a previously stored APN rate control
parameters value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored APN rate
control parameters value for this APN with the received APN rate control
parameters value.

If the UE receives an additional APN rate control parameters for
exception data container in the Protocol configuration options IE or
Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional APN
rate control parameters for exception data value and use the stored
additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value as the
maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data related to the APN
indicated in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has a previously stored
additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value for this
APN, the UE shall replace the stored additional APN rate control
parameters for exception data value for this APN with the received
additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value.

If the UE receives a small data rate control parameters container in the
Protocol configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration
options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
the UE shall store the small data rate control parameters value and use
the stored small data rate control parameters value as the maximum
allowed limit of uplink user data for the corresponding PDU session that
becomes transferred after inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [58].

If the UE receives an additional small data rate control parameters for
exception data container in the Protocol configuration options IE or the
Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional small
data rate control parameters for exception data value and use the stored
additional small data rate control parameters for exception data value
as the maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data for the
corresponding PDU session that becomes transferred after inter-system
change from S1 mode to N1 mode in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [58].

If the UE receives non-IP Link MTU parameter, Ethernet Frame Payload MTU
parameter, IPv4 Link MTU parameter, or Unstructured Link MTU parameter
of the Protocol configuration options IE or of the Extended protocol
configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message, the UE shall pass the received Non-IP Link MTU size,
Ethernet Frame Payload MTU size, or IPv4 Link MTU size, or Unstructured
Link MTU size to the upper layer.

NOTE 1: The Non-IP Link MTU and the IPv4 Link MTU size correspond to the
maximum length of user data that can be sent either in the user data
container in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message or via S1-U interface.

NOTE 2: The Ethernet frame payload MTU size corresponds to the maximum
length of a payload of an Ethernet frame that can be sent either in the
user data container in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message or via S1-U
interface.

NOTE 3: A PDN connection of non-IP PDN type can be transferred to a PDU
session of "Unstructured" PDU session type, thus the UE can request the
unstructured link MTU parameter in the default EPS bearer context
activation procedure. The unstructured link MTU size correspond to the
maximum length of user data packet that can be sent either via the
control plane or via N3 interface for a PDU session of the
"Unstructured" PDU session type as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

If the UE receives the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message containing the Uplink data not allowed parameter in the Extended
protocol configuration options IE, then the UE shall not send any uplink
user data over EPS bearer context(s) of the corresponding PDN
connection.

Upon receiving the DNS server security information, the UE shall pass it
to the upper layer. The UE shall use this information to send the DNS
over (D)TLS (See 3GPP TS 33.501 [24]).

NOTE 4: Support of DNS over (D)TLS is based on the informative
requirements as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24].

If the UE supports provisioning of ECS configuration information to the
EEC in the UE, then upon receiving:

- at least one of ECS IPv4 address(es), ECS IPv6 address(es), ECS
FQDN(s);

- at least one associated ECSP identifier; and

- optionally spatial validity conditions associated with the ECS address

in the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall pass them to
the upper layers.

NOTE 5: The IP address(es) and/or FQDN(s) are associated with the ECSP
identifier and replace previously provided ECS configuration information
associated with the same ECSP identifier, if any.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message,
the MME shall enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE and stop the timer
T3485, if the timer is running. If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
included a low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
signalling low priority", the MME shall store the NAS signalling low
priority indication within the default EPS bearer context.

If the UE indicated the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] in the UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure establishing the PDN connection, and the Extended protocol
configuration options IE of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message contains the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator,
then the UE shall perform the UE requested bearer resource modification
procedure to provide a UE policy container with the length of two octets
containing the UE STATE INDICATION message (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
annex D), otherwise the UE shall not perform the UE requested bearer
resource modification procedure to provide a UE policy container with
the length of two octets containing the UE STATE INDICATION message (see
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] annex D).

6.4.1.4 Default EPS bearer context activation not accepted by the UE

If the default EPS bearer context activation is part of the attach
procedure, the ESM sublayer shall notify the EMM sublayer of an ESM
failure. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE
and the MME, the ESM sublayer shall additionally provide an ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message to the EMM sublayer.

If the default EPS bearer context activation is not part of the attach
procedure, the UE shall send an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REJECT message and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.

The ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message contains an ESM
cause that typically indicates one of the following cause values:

#26: insufficient resources;

#31: request rejected, unspecified; or

#95 – 111: protocol errors.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message,
the MME shall enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE and stop the timer
T3485, if the timer is running.

6.4.1.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Default EPS bearer context activation request for an already
activated default EPS bearer context:

If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message with an EPS bearer identity identical to the EPS bearer identity
of an already activated default EPS bearer context, the UE shall locally
deactivate the existing default EPS bearer context and all the
associated dedicated EPS bearer contexts, if any, and proceed with the
requested default EPS bearer context activation.

b) Default EPS bearer context activation request for an already
activated dedicated EPS bearer context:

If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message with an EPS bearer identity identical to the EPS bearer identity
of an already activated dedicated EPS bearer context, the UE shall
locally deactivate the existing dedicated EPS bearer context and proceed
with the requested default EPS bearer context activation.

6.4.1.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Expiry of timer T3485:

On the first expiry of the timer T3485, the MME shall resend the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and restart
timer T3485. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the
fifth expiry of timer T3485, the MME shall release possibly allocated
resources for this activation and shall abort the procedure.

b) Lower layer indicates that the HeNB rejected the establishment of the
default bearer (see 3GPP TS 36.413 [23]) for a LIPA PDN connection or
SIPTO at the local network PDN connection due to a triggered handover:

The MME shall enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE, stop timer T3485
and reject the PDN connectivity request procedure including the ESM
cause value #34 "service option temporarily out of order" in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REJECT message. The MME shall release possibly allocated
resources for this activation.

6.4.2 Dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure

6.4.2.1 General

The purpose of the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure is
to establish an EPS bearer context with specific QoS and TFT between the
UE and the EPC.

The network may initiate the dedicated EPS bearer context activation
procedure to enable transport of a UE policy container with the length
of two octets from the network to the UE and a related UE policy
container with the length of two octets from the UE to the network. The
UE policy containers with the length of two octets enable transfer of
messages of the network-requested UE policy management procedure as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54] annex D.

In WB-S1 mode, the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure is
initiated by the network, but may be requested by the UE by means of the
UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure (see clause 6.5.3) or
the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure (see
clause 6.5.4). The dedicated bearer context activation procedure can be
part of the attach procedure or be initiated together with the default
EPS bearer context activation procedure when the UE initiated
stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure. If the attach procedure or the
default EPS bearer context activation procedure fails, the UE shall
consider that the dedicated bearer activation has implicitly failed. The
network may initiate the dedicated EPS bearer context activation
procedure together with the completion of the service request procedure.

In NB-S1 mode, the dedicated EPS bearer contexts activation procedure is
not used.

Upon an inter-system mobility from WB-S1 mode to NB-S1 mode in EMM-IDLE
mode, if the UE has at least one dedicated EPS bearer context in ESM
state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE, the UE shall locally deactivate any such
dedicated EPS bearer context and shall include the EPS bearer context
status IE in TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

Upon an inter-system change from WB-N1 mode to NB-S1 mode in EMM-IDLE
mode for the UE operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall set
each mapped dedicated EPS bearer context, if any, to ESM state BEARER
CONTEXT INACTIVE and shall then include the EPS bearer context status IE
in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

NOTE: 3GPP TS 23.060 [74] clause 9.3 specifies that a packet filter
applicable for the downlink direction is not mandatory in a TFT.

6.4.2.2 Dedicated EPS bearer context activation initiated by the network

In WB-S1 mode, the MME shall initiate the dedicated bearer context
activation procedure by sending an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message, start the timer T3485, and enter the state BEARER
CONTEXT ACTIVE PENDING (see example in figure 6.4.2.2.1).

The MME allocates the EPS bearer identity selecting a value as specified
by clause 9.3.2, and includes it in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message. The MME shall include the EPS bearer identity
of the associated default bearer as the linked EPS bearer identity in
the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. If this
procedure was initiated by a UE requested bearer resource allocation
procedure or a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, the
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST shall contain the
procedure transaction identity (PTI) value received by the MME in the
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST respectively.

Figure 6.4.2.2.1: Dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure

6.4.2.3 Dedicated EPS bearer context activation accepted by the UE

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message, if the UE provided an APN for the establishment of the PDN
connection, the UE shall stop timer T3396, if it is running for the APN
provided by the UE. If the UE did not provide an APN for the
establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different
from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the
UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running.
If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was
received for an emergency PDN connection, the UE shall not stop the
timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. For any case, the
UE shall then check the received TFT before taking it into use, send an
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message and enter the state
BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE. The ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT
message shall include the EPS bearer identity.

The linked EPS bearer identity included in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message indicates to the UE to which default
bearer, IP address and PDN the dedicated bearer is linked.

If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a
PTI value other than "no procedure transaction identity assigned" and
"reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]), the UE uses the PTI to identify
the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure to which the dedicated
bearer context activation is related.

If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a
PTI value other than "no procedure transaction identity assigned" and
"reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]) and the PTI is associated to a UE
requested bearer resource allocation procedure or a UE requested bearer
resource modification procedure, the UE shall release the traffic flow
aggregate description associated to the PTI value provided.

The UE shall use the received TFT to apply mapping of uplink traffic
flows to the radio bearer.

The UE shall treat any packet filter without explicit direction as being
bi-directional.

If the UE receives an APN rate control parameters container in the
Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration
options IE in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
the UE shall store the APN rate control parameters value and use the
stored APN rate control parameters value as the maximum allowed limit of
uplink user data related to the corresponding APN in accordance with
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has a previously stored APN rate control
parameters value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored APN rate
control parameters value for this APN with the received APN rate control
parameters value.

If the UE receives an additional APN rate control parameters for
exception data container in the Protocol configuration options IE or
Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional APN
rate control parameters for exception data value and use the stored
additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value as the
maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data related to the
corresponding APN in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has
a previously stored additional APN rate control parameters for exception
data value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored additional APN
rate control parameters for exception data value for this APN with the
received additional APN rate control parameters for exception data
value.

If the UE receives a small data rate control parameters container in the
Protocol configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration
options IE in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
the UE shall store the small data rate control parameters value and use
the stored small data rate control parameters value as the maximum
allowed limit of uplink user data for the corresponding PDU session that
becomes transferred after inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [58]. If the UE has a previously stored
small data rate control parameters value for this PDU session, the UE
shall replace the stored small data rate control parameters value for
this PDU Session with the received small data rate control parameters
value.

If the UE receives an additional small data rate control parameters for
exception data container in the protocol configuration options IE or the
extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional small
data rate control parameters for exception data value and use the stored
additional small data rate control parameters for exception data value
as the maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data for the
corresponding PDU session that becomes transferred after inter-system
change from S1 mode to N1 mode in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [58].
If the UE has a previously stored additional small data rate control
parameters for exception data value for this PDU session, the UE shall
replace the stored additional small data rate control parameters for
exception data value for this PDU session with the received additional
small data rate control parameters for exception data value.

If the UE receives QoS rule(s) of the 5GS QoS flow(s), which corresponds
to the dedicated EPS bearer being activated, in the Protocol
configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options
IE of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE
stores the QoS rule(s) for use during inter-system change from S1 mode
to N1 mode.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message, if the UE indicated the URSP provisioning in EPS support
indicator as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] in the UE requested PDN
connectivity procedure establishing the PDN connection, and the UE
policy container with the length of two octets as defined in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] is included in the Extended protocol configuration
options IE of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message:

a) the UE shall forward the UE policy container with the length of two
octets to the UE policy delivery service (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
annex D); and

b) upon receipt of a UE policy container with the length of two octets
from the UE policy delivery service, the UE shall include the UE policy
container with the length of two octets from the UE policy delivery
service in the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.

Editor's note: (WI: eUEPO, CR: 3936) URSP provisioning in EPS in a PDN
connection interworked from a PDU session, is FFS.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT
message, the MME shall stop the timerT3485 and enter the state BEARER
CONTEXT ACTIVE.

6.4.2.4 Dedicated EPS bearer context activation not accepted by the UE

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message, the UE may reject the request from the MME by sending an
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message. The message shall
include the EPS bearer identity and an ESM cause value indicating the
reason for rejecting the dedicated EPS bearer context activation
request.

The ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message contains an ESM
cause that typically indicates one of the following ESM cause values:

#26: insufficient resources;

#31: request rejected, unspecified;

#41: semantic error in the TFT operation;

#42: syntactical error in the TFT operation;

#43: invalid EPS bearer identity;

#44: semantic error(s) in packet filter(s);

#45: syntactical error(s) in packet filter(s); or

#95 – 111: protocol errors.

The UE shall check the TFT in the request message for different types of
TFT IE errors as follows:

a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

1) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Create a new TFT"

The UE shall reject the activation request with ESM cause #41 "semantic
error in the TFT operation".

b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and the packet filter
list in the TFT IE is empty.

2) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the
TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters
subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

The UE shall reject the activation request with ESM cause #42
"syntactical error in the TFT operation".

c) Semantic errors in packet filters:

1) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components
which would render the packet filter ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will
ever fit this packet filter. How the UE determines a semantic error in a
packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

2) When the resulting TFT does not contain any packet filter which
applicable for the uplink direction.

The UE shall reject the activation request with ESM cause #44 "semantic
errors in packet filter(s)".

d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and two or more packet
filters in the resultant TFT would have identical packet filter
identifiers.

2) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and two or more packet
filters in all TFTs associated with this PDN connection would have
identical packet filter precedence values.

3) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of
packet filters, such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter
component identifier.

In case 2, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS
bearer context, the UE shall not diagnose an error, shall further
process the new activation request and, if it was processed
successfully, shall delete the old packet filters which have identical
filter precedence values. Furthermore, by means of explicit peer-to-peer
signalling between the network and the UE, the UE shall perform a UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure to delete the packet
filters in the network corresponding to the packet filters it has
deleted on the UE side.

In case 2, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS
bearer context, the UE shall release the relevant PDN connection. If the
relevant PDN connection is the last one that the UE has and
EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the
MME, the UE shall detach and re-attach to the network.

In cases 1 and 3 the UE shall reject the activation request with ESM
cause #45 "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)".

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message
in state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE PENDING, the MME shall stop the timer
T3485, enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE and abort the dedicated
EPS bearer context activation procedure. The MME also requests the lower
layer to release the radio resources that were established during the
dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure.

6.4.2.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Dedicated EPS bearer context activation request for an already
activated default EPS bearer context:

If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message with an EPS bearer identity identical to the EPS bearer identity
of an already activated default EPS bearer context, the UE shall locally
deactivate the existing default EPS bearer context and all the
associated dedicated EPS bearer contexts, if any, and proceed with the
requested dedicated EPS bearer context activation.

b) Dedicated EPS bearer context activation request for an already
activated dedicated EPS bearer context

If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message with an EPS bearer identity identical to the EPS bearer identity
of an already activated dedicated EPS bearer context, the UE shall
locally deactivate the existing dedicated EPS bearer context and proceed
with the requested dedicated EPS bearer context activation.

c) No default EPS bearer context with linked EPS bearer identity
activated

If the linked EPS bearer identity included in the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message does not match the EPS bearer identity of
any activated default EPS bearer context, the UE shall reply with an
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause #43
"invalid EPS bearer identity".

d) Dedicated EPS bearer context activation request when the PLMN's
maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode is reached at the UE:

If the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode is
reached at the UE and the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall clear the determination
representing the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode
and proceed with the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure.

6.4.2.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Expiry of timer T3485:

On the first expiry of the timer T3485, the MME shall resend the
ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and
restart timer T3485. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on
the fifth expiry of timer T3485, the MME shall abort the procedure,
release any resources allocated for this activation and enter the state
BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.

b) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and dedicated EPS
bearer context activation procedure:

When the MME receives a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message during the
dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure, and the EPS bearer to
be activated belongs to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect,
the MME shall terminate the dedicated bearer context activation
procedure locally, release any resources related to this procedure and
proceed with the PDN disconnect procedure.

6.4.3 EPS bearer context modification procedure

6.4.3.1 General

The purpose of the EPS bearer context modification procedure is to
modify an EPS bearer context with a specific QoS and TFT, or
re-negotiate header compression configuration associated to an EPS
bearer context. The EPS bearer context modification procedure is
initiated by the network, but it may also be initiated as part of the UE
requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE requested
bearer resource modification procedure.

The network may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification
procedure to update the APN-AMBR of the UE, for instance after an
inter-system handover. See 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] annex E.

The MME may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure
to update the WLAN offload indication to the UE, for instance after the
MME received an updated WLAN offload indication of a PDN Connection from
HSS. See 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] clause 4.3.23.

The MME may also initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure
to update information required for inter-system change from S1 mode to
N1 mode (e.g. session-AMBR, QoS rule(s)). See 3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

The network may initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure
together with the completion of the service request procedure.

The network may initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure
to initiate the procedure for the UUAA-SM for the UAS services.

The network may initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure
to enable transport of a UE policy container with the length of two
octets from the network to the UE and a related UE policy container with
the length of two octets from the UE to the network. The UE policy
containers with the length of two octets enable transfer of messages of
the network-requested UE policy management procedure as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54] annex D.

6.4.3.2 EPS bearer context modification initiated by the network

The MME shall initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure by
sending a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to the UE, starting
the timer T3486, and entering the state BEARER CONTEXT MODIFY PENDING
(see example in figure 6.4.3.2.1).

The MME shall include an EPS bearer identity that identifies the EPS
bearer context to be modified in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message.

If this procedure was initiated by a UE requested bearer resource
allocation procedure or a UE requested bearer resource modification
procedure, the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST shall contain the
procedure transaction identity (PTI) value received by the MME in the
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST message respectively.

If the UE indicated "Control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported" and
"Header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported"
in the UE network capability IE in the latest ATTACH REQUEST message or
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, and the MME supports Control
plane CIoT EPS optimization and Header compression for control plane
CIoT EPS optimization, the MME may include the Header compression
configuration IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to
re-negotiate header compression configuration associated to an EPS
bearer context.

Figure 6.4.3.2.1: EPS bearer context modification procedure

6.4.3.3 EPS bearer context modification accepted by the UE

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the UE
provided an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection, the UE
shall stop timer T3396, if it is running for the APN provided by the UE.
If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN
connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from
"handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer
T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. If the MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message was received for an emergency PDN connection,
the UE shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is
running. For any case, the UE shall then check the received TFT before
taking it into use and send a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message
to the MME.

If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value
other than "no procedure transaction identity assigned" and "reserved"
(see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]), the UE uses the PTI to identify the UE
requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE requested
bearer resource modification procedure to which the EPS bearer context
modification is related (see clause 6.5.3 and clause 6.5.4).

If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI value
other than "no procedure transaction identity assigned" and "reserved"
(see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]) and the PTI is associated to a UE requested
bearer resource allocation procedure or a UE requested bearer resource
modification procedure, the UE shall release the traffic flow aggregate
description associated to the PTI value provided.

If the EPS bearer context that is modified is a GBR bearer and the
MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message does not contain the
Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and the Maximum Bit Rate (MBR) values for
uplink and downlink, the UE shall continue to use the previously
received values for the Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and the Maximum Bit
Rate (MBR) for the corresponding bearer.

The UE shall use the received TFT to apply mapping of uplink traffic
flows to the radio bearer if the TFT contains packet filters for the
uplink direction.

If a WLAN offload indication information element is included in the
MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the WLAN
offload acceptability values for this PDN connection and use the E-UTRAN
offload acceptability value to determine whether this PDN connection is
offloadable to WLAN or not.

If the UE receives an APN rate control parameters container in the
Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration
options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE
shall store the APN rate control parameters value and use the stored APN
rate control parameters value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink
user data related to the corresponding APN in accordance with
3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has a previously stored APN rate control
parameters value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored APN rate
control parameters value for this APN with the received APN rate control
parameters value.

If the UE receives an additional APN rate control parameters for
exception data container in the Protocol configuration options IE or
Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional APN rate
control parameters for exception data value and use the stored
additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value as the
maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data related to the
corresponding APN in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]. If the UE has
a previously stored additional APN rate control parameters for exception
data value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored additional APN
rate control parameters for exception data value for this APN with the
received additional APN rate control parameters for exception data
value.

If the UE receives a small data rate control parameters container in the
Protocol configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration
options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE
shall store the small data rate control parameters value and use the
stored small data rate control parameters value as the maximum allowed
limit of uplink user data for the corresponding PDU session that becomes
transferred after inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [58]. If the UE has a previously stored
small data rate control parameters value for this PDU session, the UE
shall replace the stored small data rate control parameters value for
this PDU Session with the received small data rate control parameters
value.

If the UE receives an additional small data rate control parameters for
exception data container in the Protocol configuration options IE or the
Extended protocol configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional small data
rate control parameters for exception data value and use the stored
additional small data rate control parameters for exception data value
as the maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data for the
corresponding PDU session that becomes transferred after inter-system
change from S1 mode to N1 mode in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [58].
If the UE has a previously stored additional small data rate control
parameters for exception data value for this PDU session, the UE shall
replace the stored additional small data rate control parameters for
exception data value for this PDU session with the received additional
small data rate control parameters for exception data value.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with a
session-AMBR and QoS rule(s) in the Protocol configuration options IE or
the Extended protocol configuration options IE, the UE stores the
session-AMBR and QoS rule(s) for use during inter-system change from S1
mode to N1 mode.

If the UE receives the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
containing the Uplink data allowed parameter in the Extended protocol
configuration options IE, then the UE may start transmitting uplink user
data over EPS bearer context(s) of the corresponding PDN connection.

The MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message as a part of authorization
procedure for the C2 communication, can include an Extended protocol
configuration options IE containing the service-level-AA container with
the length of two octets. The service-level-AA container with the length
of two octets:

a) contains the service-level-AA response with the C2AR field set to the
C2 authorization result informed by the UAS NF;

b) can contain the service-level-AA payload parameter set to the C2
authorization payload and the service-level-AA payload type parameter
set to "C2 authorization payload"; and

c) can contain the service-level device ID with the value set to a new
CAA-level UAV ID.

NOTE 1: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload can
include one, some or all of the pairing information for C2
communication, the C2 session security information, and the pairing
information for direct C2 communication.

If the EPS bearer context being modified is associated with a PDN
connection for UAS services and the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message includes the service-level-AA container with the length of two
octets in the Extended protocol configuration options IE, the UE
supporting UAS services shall forward the contents of the
service-level-AA container with the length of two octets to the upper
layers.

If the EPS bearer context being modified is associated with a PDN
connection for UAS services, the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message includes the Extended protocol configuration options IE
containing the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets
containing the service-level-AA response parameter with the SLAR field
set to "Service level authentication and authorization was successful",
the UE supporting UAS services:

a) shall consider the UUAA procedure as successfully completed and
provide the service-level-AA response to the upper layers;

b) if the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets
contains the service-level device ID parameter carrying a CAA-level UAV
ID, shall provide the CAA-level UAV ID to the upper layers; and

c) if the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets
contains the service-level-AA payload type parameter with the value
"UUAA payload" and the service-level-AA payload parameter carrying the
UUAA payload, shall provide the UUAA payload to the upper layers.

Upon reception of a service-level-AA payload from the upper layers, the
UE supporting UAS services shall include the Extended protocol
configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT
message. In the Extended protocol configuration options IE, the UE shall
include the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets. In
the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets, the UE
shall:

a) include the service-level-AA payload parameter set to the
service-level-AA payload received from the upper layers; and

b) set the service-level-AA payload type parameter to the type of the
service-level-AA payload.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the
SDNAEPC EAP message with the length of two octets is included in the
Extended protocol configuration options IE, the UE supporting secondary
DN authentication and authorization over EPC shall forward the SDNAEPC
EAP message with the length of two octets to the upper layers.

Upon reception of an SDNAEPC EAP message with the length of two octets
from the upper layers and if the UE has received an SDNAEPC EAP message
with the length of two octets included in the Extended protocol
configuration options IE of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message from the network, the UE supporting secondary DN authentication
and authorization over EPC shall include the Extended protocol
configuration options IE in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message
and include the SDNAEPC EAP message with the length of two octets in the
Extended protocol configuration options IE.

If the UE supports provisioning of ECS configuration information to the
EEC in the UE, then upon receiving:

- at least one of ECS IPv4 address(es), ECS IPv6 address(es), ECS
FQDN(s);

- at least one associated ECSP identifier; and

- optionally spatial validity conditions associated with the ECS address

in the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the MODIFY EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall pass them to the upper
layers.

NOTE 2: The IP address(es) and/or FQDN(s) are associated with the ECSP
identifier and replace previously provided ECS configuration information
associated with the same ECSP identifier, if any.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the UE
indicated the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13] in the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure
establishing the PDN connection, and the UE policy container with the
length of two octets as defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] is included in
the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message:

a) the UE shall forward the UE policy container with the length of two
octets to the UE policy delivery service (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
annex D); and

b) upon receipt of a UE policy container with the length of two octets
from the UE policy delivery service, the UE shall include the UE policy
container with the length of two octets from the UE policy delivery
service in the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the MODIFY
EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.

Editor's note: (WI: eUEPO, CR: 3934) URSP provisioning in EPS in a PDN
connection interworked from a PDU session, is FFS.

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the MME
shall stop the timer T3486 and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE.

6.4.3.4 EPS bearer context modification not accepted by the UE

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE
may reject the request from the MME by sending a MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REJECT message to the MME. The message shall include the EPS
bearer identity and an ESM cause value indicating the reason for
rejecting the EPS bearer context modification request.

The MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message contains an ESM cause that
typically indicates one of the following ESM cause values:

#26: insufficient resources;

#41: semantic error in the TFT operation;

#42: syntactical error in the TFT operation;

#43: invalid EPS bearer identity;

#44: semantic error(s) in packet filter(s);

#45: syntactical error(s) in packet filter(s); or

#95 – 111: protocol errors.

The UE shall check the TFT in the request message for different types of
TFT IE errors as follows:

a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

1) TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" when there is already an existing
TFT for the EPS bearer context.

2) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Create a new TFT",
the EPS bearer context being modified is the default EPS bearer content
and there is no TFT for the default EPS bearer context.

3) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" when it
would render the TFT empty.

4) TFT operation = "Delete existing TFT" for a dedicated EPS bearer
context.

In case 4 the UE shall reject the modification request with ESM cause
#41 "semantic error in the TFT operation".

In the other cases the UE shall not diagnose an error and perform the
following actions to resolve the inconsistency:

In case 1 the UE shall further process the new activation request to
create a new TFT and, if it was processed successfully, delete the old
TFT.

In case 2 the UE shall:

- process the new request and if the TFT operation is "Delete existing
TFT" or "Delete packet filters from existing TFT", and if no error
according to items b, c, and d was detected, consider the TFT as
successfully deleted;

- process the new request as an activation request, if the TFT operation
is "Add packet filters in existing TFT" or "Replace packet filters in
existing TFT".

In case 3, if the packet filters belong to a dedicated EPS bearer
context, the UE shall process the new deletion request and, if no error
according to items b, c, and d was detected, the UE shall reject the
modification request with ESM cause #41 "semantic error in the TFT
operation".

In case 3, if the packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer
context, the UE shall process the new deletion request and if no error
according to items b, c, and d was detected then delete the existing
TFT, this corresponds to using match-all packet filter for the default
EPS bearer context.

b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT", "Add packet filters in
existing TFT", "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" or "Delete
packet filters from existing TFT" and the packet filter list in the TFT
IE is empty.

2) TFT operation = "Delete existing TFT" or "No TFT operation" with a
non-empty packet filter list in the TFT IE.

3) TFT operation = "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" when the
packet filter to be replaced does not exist in the original TFT.

4) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" when the
packet filter to be deleted does not exist in the original TFT.

5) Void.

6) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the
TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters
subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

In case 3 the UE shall not diagnose an error, further process the
replace request and, if no error according to items c and d was
detected, include the packet filters received to the existing TFT.

In case 4 the UE shall not diagnose an error, further process the
deletion request and, if no error according to items c and d was
detected, consider the respective packet filter as successfully deleted.

Otherwise the UE shall reject the modification request with ESM cause
#42 "syntactical error in the TFT operation".

NOTE: An implementation that strictly follows packet filter list as
defined in subclause 10.5.6.12 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] might not detect
case 2).

c) Semantic errors in packet filters:

1) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components
which would render the packet filter ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will
ever fit this packet filter. How the UE determines a semantic error in a
packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

2) When the resulting TFT, which is assigned to a dedicated EPS bearer
context, does not contain any packet filter applicable for the uplink
direction among the packet filters created on request from the network.

The UE shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #44
"semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT", "Add packet filters to
existing TFT", or "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" and two or
more packet filters in the resultant TFT would have identical packet
filter identifiers.

2) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT", "Add packet filters to
existing TFT" or "Replace packet filters in existing TFT", and two or
more packet filters among all TFTs associated with this PDN connection
would have identical packet filter precedence values.

3) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of
packet filters, such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter
component identifier.

In case 1, if two or more packet filters with identical packet filter
identifiers are contained in the new request, the UE shall reject the
modification request with ESM cause #45 "syntactical errors in packet
filter(s)". Otherwise, the UE shall not diagnose an error, further
process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, delete
the old packet filters which have the identical packet filter
identifiers.

In case 2, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS
bearer context, the UE shall not diagnose an error, shall further
process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall
delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence
values. Furthermore, the UE shall perform a UE requested bearer resource
modification procedure to delete the packet filters in the network
corresponding to the packet filters it has deleted on the UE side.

In case 2, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS
bearer context, the UE shall release the relevant PDN connection. If the
relevant PDN connection is the last one that the UE has and
EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the
MME, the UE shall detach and re-attach to the network.

Otherwise the UE shall reject the modification request with ESM cause
#45 "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)".

Upon receipt of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM
cause value other than #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity" in state BEARER
CONTEXT MODIFY PENDING, the MME shall stop the timer T3486, enter the
state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE and abort the EPS bearer context
modification procedure. If the network receives the MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity",
the MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) without
peer-to-peer ESM signalling. When the MME detects that after the failed
EPS bearer context modification there is a misalignment between the EPS
bearer configuration and the EPS bearer context configuration or between
the QoS on NAS and AS level, the MME should initiate the necessary
procedures to achieve a re-alignment.

6.4.3.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

Apart from the case described in clause 6.3.3, the following abnormal
cases can be identified:

a) Collision of UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and
EPS bearer context modification procedure:

If the UE receives a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message during
the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, the Procedure
transaction identity IE of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
is set to "No procedure transaction identity assigned" and the EPS
bearer indicated in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is the
EPS bearer that the UE had requested to modify, the UE shall abort
internally the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, and:

- if the UE had initiated resource release for all the traffic flows for
the bearer and the UE still needs to release the bearer (e.g. the TFT is
empty due to error cases described in subclause 6.4.2.4 or
subclause 6.4.3.4), the UE may proceed with the EPS bearer context
modification procedure (i.e. respond with a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT
ACCEPT message or a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message) and
deactivate the EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-peer
signalling between the UE and the MME. In order to synchronize the EPS
bearer context status with the MME, the UE may send a TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message that includes the EPS bearer context status IE to
the MME; or

- otherwise, the UE shall enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE and
proceed with the EPS bearer context modification procedure.

6.4.3.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Expiry of timer T3486:

On the first expiry of the timer T3486, the MME shall resend the MODIFY
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3486. This
retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
T3486, the MME shall abort the procedure and enter the state BEARER
CONTEXT ACTIVE.

The MME may continue to use the previous configuration of the EPS bearer
context or initiate an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

b) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and EPS bearer
context modification:

When the MME receives a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message during an EPS
bearer context modification procedure, and the EPS bearer to be modified
belongs to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect, the MME shall
terminate the EPS bearer context modification procedure locally, release
any resources related to this procedure and proceed with the PDN
disconnect procedure.

c) Collision of UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and
EPS bearer context modification procedure:

If the MME receives a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message
during the EPS bearer context modification procedure and the EPS bearer
indicated in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message is the EPS
bearer that the network had requested to modify, the network shall
ignore the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message received in the
state BEATER CONTEXT MODIFY PENDING. The network shall proceed with the
EPS bearer modification procedure as if no BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST message was received from the UE.

6.4.4 EPS bearer context deactivation procedure

6.4.4.1 General

The purpose of the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is to
deactivate an EPS bearer context or disconnect from a PDN by
deactivating all EPS bearer contexts to the PDN. The EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure is initiated by the network, and it may be
triggered by the UE by means of the UE requested bearer resource
modification procedure or UE requested PDN disconnect procedure.

In the case of EPS bearer context deactivation with reactivation
requested for a PDN connection, if no NAS signalling connection exists,
the MME follows the procedures for re-establishing the NAS signalling
connection and deactivating the EPS bearer contexts to the PDN with
reactivation requested, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]
clauses 5.4.4.1 and 5.10.3 and 3GPP TS 23.380 [33] clause 5.4.2.1.

If a UE is receiving emergency bearer services from a CSG cell, and the
CSG subscription expires or is removed, the MME shall deactivate all
non-emergency EPS bearers if any. The MME shall not deactivate the
emergency EPS bearers.

If a detach is requested by the HSS for a UE that has bearers for
emergency services, the MME shall send a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message to the UE for all bearers that are not allocated for
emergency services.

6.4.4.2 EPS bearer context deactivation initiated by the network

If a NAS signalling connection exists when the MME initiates the EPS
bearer context deactivation procedure, the MME shall initiate the EPS
bearer context deactivation procedure by sending a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message to the UE, start the timer T3495, and enter the
state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE PENDING (see example in figure 6.4.4.2.1).
The DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains an ESM cause
typically indicating one of the following:

#8: operator determined barring;

#26: insufficient resources;

#29: user authentication or authorization failed;

#36: regular deactivation;

#38: network failure;

#39: reactivation requested;

#112: APN restriction value incompatible with active EPS bearer context;
or

#113: Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed.

If the deactivation is triggered by a UE initiated bearer resource
modification procedure or UE requested PDN disconnect procedure, the
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message shall contain the
procedure transaction identity (PTI) value received by the MME in the
BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST
respectively.

When the MME wants to deactivate all EPS bearer contexts of a PDN
connection and thus disconnect the UE from the PDN, the MME shall
include the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer associated to the
PDN in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. In this case,
the MME shall not include the WLAN offload indication in the DEACTIVATE
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, and if the UE receives the WLAN
offload indication, the UE shall ignore the indication.

NOTE 1: If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains
the UAS services not allowed indication in the Extended protocol
configuration options IE, then the ESM cause value #29 "user
authentication or authorization failed" is included in the DEACTIVATE
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.

If no NAS signalling connection exists when the MME initiates the EPS
bearer context deactivation, the ESM entity in the MME shall locally
deactivate the EPS bearer context towards the UE without any
peer-to-peer ESM signalling between the MME and the UE.

NOTE 2: The EPS bearer context state(s) can be synchronized between the
UE and the MME at the next EMM-IDLE to EMM-CONNECTED transition, e.g.
during a service request or tracking area updating procedure.

Figure 6.4.4.2.1: EPS bearer context deactivation procedure

6.4.4.3 EPS bearer context deactivation accepted by the UE

Upon receipt of the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the
UE shall delete the EPS bearer context identified by the EPS bearer
identity. After deactivating the identified EPS bearer context, the UE
shall respond to the MME with the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT.

If the EPS bearer identity indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST is that of the default bearer to a PDN, the UE shall
delete all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN. After deactivating
all EPS bearer contexts, the UE shall respond to the MME with the
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT.

Upon sending the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the UE
shall enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE. If due to the EPS bearer
context deactivation only the PDN connection for emergency bearer
services remains established, the UE shall consider itself attached for
emergency bearer services only.

If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST includes ESM cause #39
"reactivation requested" and the EPS bearer context is a default EPS
bearer context, and the UE provided an APN for the establishment of the
PDN connection, the UE shall stop timer T3396 if it is running for the
APN provided by the UE. The UE should then re-initiate the UE requested
PDN connectivity procedure for the same APN as the deactivated default
EPS bearer context to reactivate the EPS bearer context. If the UE did
not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the
request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated
with no APN if it is running, and should re-initiate the UE requested
PDN connectivity procedure without including an APN. Additionally, the
UE should re-initiate the request(s) for dedicated bearer resources that
have been activated on request of the UE and released as a result of
this EPS bearer context deactivation procedure. If the DEACTIVATE EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received for an emergency PDN
connection, the UE shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN
if it is running. The UE should then re-initiate the UE requested PDN
connectivity procedure for the emergency PDN connection.

NOTE 1: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot
re-activate the EPS bearer context(s) automatically.

NOTE 2: The UE behaviour is not specified for the case where the
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST includes ESM cause #39
"reactivation requested" and the deactivated EPS bearer context was a
dedicated EPS bearer context.

If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI
value other than "no procedure transaction identity assigned" and
"reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]), the UE uses the PTI to identify
the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure or UE requested
PDN disconnect procedure to which the EPS bearer context deactivation is
related (see clause 6.5.4).

If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains a PTI
value other than "no procedure transaction identity assigned" and
"reserved" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]), the UE shall release the traffic
flow aggregate description associated to the PTI value provided.

If the ESM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources", the network may
include a value for timer T3396 in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message. The UE shall take different actions depending on the
timer value received for timer T3396 (if the UE is configured for dual
priority, exceptions are specified in clause 6.5.5; if the UE is a UE
configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified
in clause 6.3.5):

i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if it is
running. The UE shall start timer T3396 with received value and not send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
with exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN until timer T3396 expires or
the timer T3396 is stopped. If the UE did not provide an APN for the
establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different
from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the
UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN, if it is running. The
UE shall start timer T3396 with the received value and not send another
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN and with request type
different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with
exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection
established without an APN provided by the UE, until timer T3396 expires
or timer T3396 is stopped. The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN
change or inter-system change;

ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE
shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE
receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE
DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message for the same APN from the network or a DEACTIVATE EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation
requested" for a default EPS bearer context for the same APN from the
network. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the
PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and
from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall not send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN and with request
type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with
exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection
established without APN provided by the UE , until the UE is switched
off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or
MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN
connection established without an APN provided by the UE, or a
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39
"reactivation requested" for a default EPS bearer context of a
non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the
UE. The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or
inter-system change; and

iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

- shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if
running, and may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for
the same APN; and

- if the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN
connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from
"handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer T3396
associated with no APN, if running, and may send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN, or another BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a
non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the
UE.

If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, the UE shall
behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE
remains the same:

- let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1;

- if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running for a specific APN,
because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message containing the low
priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
priority" was rejected with timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted
at switch on, then the UE configured for dual priority shall handle
session management requests as indicated in clause 6.5.5; and

- if prior to switch off timer T3396 was running because a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST
message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured
for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with timer T3396, and if
timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE configured for dual
priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in
clause 6.5.5.

If the T3396 IE is not included, the UE shall proceed with deactivation
procedure and then send DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.

Upon receipt of the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the
MME shall enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE and stop the timer
T3495.

6.4.4.4 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) UE is requested to deactivate a default EPS bearer context of the
last PDN connection:

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or
the MME, and the UE determines that the EPS bearer indicated in the
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is the default EPS bearer
of the last PDN connection that the UE has, then the UE shall respond by
performing a detach procedure. Additionally, the UE should perform an
attach procedure.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME, the UE shall proceed with the deactivation procedure as specified
in clause 6.4.4.3.

NOTE: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot
re-activate the EPS bearer(s), if any, automatically.

6.4.4.5 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Expiry of timer T3495:

On the first expiry of the timer T3495, the MME shall resend the
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer
T3495. This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth
expiry of timer T3495, the MME shall abort the procedure and deactivate
the EPS bearer context locally without any peer-to-peer ESM signalling
between the MME and the UE.

b) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and EPS bearer
context deactivation:

When the MME receives a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message during the EPS
bearer context deactivation procedure, and the EPS bearer indicated in
the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is a dedicated EPS
bearer belonging to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect, the
MME shall proceed with both procedures. If the EPS bearer indicated in
the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is the default EPS
bearer, the MME shall proceed with the EPS bearer context deactivation
procedure.

6.4.4.6 Local EPS bearer context deactivation without NAS signalling

The UE and the MME deactivate EPS bearer contexts locally without
peer-to-peer ESM signalling in the following cases:

1) during the service request procedure, if the E-UTRAN establishes the
user plane radio bearers for one or more EPS bearer contexts but not for
all the EPS bearer contexts, e.g. due to radio access control (see
clause 5.6.1.4 for details);

1a) during the resume of NAS signalling connection procedure as
specified in clause 5.3.1.3, if one or more but not all the suspended
user plane radio bearers are resumed;

2) during the tracking area updating procedure but the network
established the user plane radio bearers due to downlink pending data,
if the E-UTRAN establishes the user plane radio bearers for one or more
EPS bearer contexts but not for all the EPS bearer contexts indicated
active by both UE and network;

NOTE 1: The synchronisation of the EPS bearers, for which the user plane
radio bearers need to be established, indicated in EPS bearer context
status information element in TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is not
applicable in item 2.

3) during handover, if the target E-UTRAN does not establish all the
user plane radio bearers for the UE;

4) if the E-UTRAN releases one or more user plane radio bearers but not
all the user plane radio bearers of the UE due to E-UTRAN specific
reasons; or

5) if triggered by an NBIFOM procedure (see 3GPP TS 24.161 [36]), for an
NBIFOM multi-access PDN connection.

For cases 1) to 4), based on the indication from the lower layers, the
UE and the MME shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer contexts for
which no user plane radio bearers are set up.

NOTE 2: The above cases 1) to 4) do not apply for the UE when an RRC
connection release occurs. The lower layers in the UE provide the user
plane radio bearer context status to the ESM sublayer when a change in
the user plane radio bearers is detected by the lower layers including
establishment and release of user plane radio bearers for the UE in
connected mode.

NOTE 3: The above cases 1) to 4) do not apply for the MME when the S1
release procedure occurs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

If due to any of the cases described above the UE locally deactivates a
default EPS bearer context, the UE shall locally deactivate all EPS
bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS
bearer context.

If the UE locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last
remaining PDN connection, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall perform a local detach
and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED. If this occurs during a service
request procedure for CS fallback, the UE shall reselect to GERAN or
UTRAN and continue with the CS service, otherwise the UE shall initiate
an attach procedure.

If the UE locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last
remaining PDN connection, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.

If the UE locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last
remaining PDN connection for non-emergency bearer services and only the
PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established, the UE
shall consider itself attached for emergency bearer services only.

The MME shall deactivate the GBR EPS bearer contexts locally without
peer-to-peer ESM signalling, when the MME performs locally the release
of the S1AP signalling connection due to the S1AP signalling connection
is lost. All non-GBR EPS bearers established are preserved in the MME
and in the PDN GW.

If the E‑UTRAN requests the MME to release the S1AP signalling
connection, the MME shall deactivate or preserve the GBR EPS bearer
contexts according to 3GPP TS 23.401 [10], clause 5.3.5. All non-GBR EPS
bearer contexts established are preserved in the MME and in the PDN GW.

NOTE 4: The UE and the MME will synchronize the EPS bearer contexts
subsequently during the next service request procedure, tracking area
updating procedure or routing area updating procedure.

If due to any of the cases described above the MME locally deactivates a
default EPS bearer context, the MME shall locally deactivate all EPS
bearer contexts associated to the PDN connection with the default EPS
bearer context without peer-to-peer ESM signalling to the UE.

If the MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last
remaining PDN connection, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
not supported by the UE or the MME, the MME shall perform a local detach
and enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED.

If the MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last
remaining PDN connection, and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
supported by the UE and the MME, the MME shall enter state
EMM-REGISTERED.

For EPS bearer context deactivation procedure initiated by the network,
if no NAS signalling connection exists, the MME locally deactivates the
EPS bearer context(s) without peer-to-peer ESM signalling In the case of
reactivation requested, the MME can perform this local deactivation only
when the EMM-entity in the network was unable to re-establish the NAS
signalling connection. The EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is
not initiated by the network when the MME disconnects the UE from the
last remaining PDN to which it is connected and EMM-REGISTERED without
PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME. In this case, the
MME initiates a network initiated detach procedure.

If the MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) of the last
remaining PDN connection for non-emergency bearer services and only the
PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established for the
UE, the MME shall consider the UE to be attached for emergency bearer
services only.

6.5 UE requested ESM procedures

6.5.0 General

The UE's maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts in a PLMN is
determined by whichever is the lowest of the maximum number of EPS
bearer identities allowed by the protocol (as specified in
3GPP TS 24.007 [12] clause 11.2.3.1.5), the PLMN's maximum number of EPS
bearer contexts in S1 mode and the UE's implementation-specific maximum
number of EPS bearer contexts.

NOTE 1: Clauses 6.5.1.4 and 6.5.3.4 specify how the UE determines the
PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode.

In earlier versions of the protocol, the maximum number of
simultaneously active EPS bearer contexts was limited by lower layer
protocols to 8.

In the present version of the protocol, the UE and the network may
support a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts.

A UE supporting signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer
contexts shall support the extended range or EPS bearer identities from
0 to 15 (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12] clause 11.2.3.1.5). The UE
indicates support of signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer
contexts by setting the 15 bearers bit in the UE Network Capability IE.

A network supporting signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer
contexts shall support the extended range or EPS bearer identities from
0 to 15 (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12] clause 11.2.3.1.5). The
network indicates support of signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS
bearer contexts by setting the 15 bearers bit in the EPS network feature
support IE.

NOTE 2: A UE and a network not supporting signalling for a maximum
number of 15 EPS bearer contexts will treat the EPS bearer identity
values 1 to 4 as 'reserved' values.

For a UE in NB-S1 mode, the UE's implementation-specific maximum number
of active user plane radio bearers is 2 (as defined in
3GPP TS 36.300 [20]) when the UE sets the Multiple DRB support bit to
"Multiple DRB supported" during attach or tracking area updating
procedures, and 1 otherwise.

Upon an inter-system change from N1 mode to NB-S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode
for the UE operating in single-registration mode, if:

a) the number of active default EPS bearer contexts in the UE is larger
than the UE's implementation-specific maximum number of active user
plane radio bearers; and

b) the UE is using user plane CIoT EPS optimization;

the UE shall locally deactivate at least one default EPS bearer context
such that the total number of active default EPS bearer contexts that
remained does not exceed the UE's implementation-specific maximum number
of active user plane radio bearers. In this case, choosing which EPS
bearer context to deactivate is implementation specific. The UE shall
then include the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message.

Upon the inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, for
any PDN connection that has been transferred, if the PDN connection is
not associated with a PDU session ID and the UE supporting N1 mode
decides to enable the transfer of the PDN connection from S1 mode to N1
mode, the UE may first initiate the UE requested PDN disconnection
procedure and then the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for such
PDN connection(s). As an implementation option, the UE may deactivate
all EPS bearer contexts for such PDN connection(s) locally, and if the
last PDN connection is not deactivated or the UE supports EMM-REGISTERED
without PDN connection, the UE shall include the EPS bearer context
status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message of the tracking
area updating procedure upon inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu
mode to S1 mode, and then initiate UE requested PDN connectivity
procedure for such PDN connection(s).

NOTE 3: Upon the inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1
mode, if a PDN connection does not support interworking with 5GS and the
UE determines that the PLMN or the APN cannot support interworking with
5GS, it is recommended that a UE does not release and re-establish the
PDN connection in order to enable interworking with 5GS for the PDN
connection. Whether and how the UE determines the PLMN or the APN can
support interworking with 5GS is implementation specific.

6.5.1 UE requested PDN connectivity procedure

6.5.1.1 General

The purpose of the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure is for a UE
to request the setup of a default EPS bearer to a PDN. The UE requests
connectivity to a PDN by sending a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to
the network. If accepted by the network, this procedure initiates the
establishment of a default EPS bearer context. If EMM-REGISTERED without
PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the procedure is
used either to establish the first default bearer by including the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message into the initial attach message, or to
establish subsequent default bearers to additional PDNs in order to
allow the UE simultaneous access to multiple PDNs by sending the message
stand-alone. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by
the UE and the MME, the procedure is used to establish the first or
subsequent default bearers to a PDN or additional PDNs by sending the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message stand-alone.

If the UE requests PDN connectivity for emergency bearer services, the
MME shall not check for regional restrictions or subscription
restrictions when processing the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

If there is already a PDN connection for emergency bearer services
established, the UE shall not request an additional PDN connection for
emergency bearer services.

A UE attached for emergency bearer services shall not request a PDN
connection to any other PDN.

A UE attached for access to RLOS shall not request any additional PDN
connection for RLOS nor any PDN connection to any other PDN.

The UE may also initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to
add 3GPP access to the PDN connection which is already established over
WLAN as specified in the clause 6.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.161 [34].

The UE may also initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to
transfer an existing PDU session in the 5GS to EPS as specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54].

If the UE supports the device triggering short message as specified in
3GPP TS 23.040 [57] and supports non-IP PDN type, then upon receiving
from ESMS entity as specified in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12] an indication
requesting establishment of a PDN connection for non-IP PDN type using
the default APN as specified in 3GPP TS 24.011 [13A], the UE shall
initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure in order to request
connectivity to a PDN using the default APN and non-IP PDN type.

6.5.1.2 UE requested PDN connectivity procedure initiation

In order to request connectivity to a PDN, the UE shall send a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to the MME, start timer T3482 and enter the
state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in figure 6.5.1.2.1).

When the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message is sent together with an
ATTACH REQUEST message, the UE shall not start timer T3482 and shall not
include the APN.

NOTE 1: If the UE needs to provide protocol configuration options which
require ciphering or provide an APN, or both, during the attach
procedure, the ESM information transfer flag is included in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST. The MME then at a later stage in the PDN
connectivity procedure initiates the ESM information request procedure
in which the UE can provide the MME with protocol configuration options
or APN or both.

In order to request a PDN connection for emergency bearer services or
for access to RLOS, the UE shall not include an APN in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message or, when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION
RESPONSE message.

In order to request connectivity to a PDN using the default APN, the UE
includes the access point name IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message or, when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message,
according to the following conditions:

- if use of a PDN using the default APN requires PAP/CHAP, then the UE
should include the Access point name IE; and

- in all other conditions, the UE need not include the Access point name
IE.

In order to request connectivity to an additional PDN using a specific
APN, the UE shall include the requested APN in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message or, when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE
message.

NOTE 2: The requested APN in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or ESM
INFORMATION RESPONSE message is for UAS services when the request to
establish a PDN connection for UAS services is requested by the upper
layers.

NOTE 3: By configuration provided by the operator, the UE supporting UAS
services knows that an APN is for UAS services when the request to
establish a PDN connection for UAS services is requested by the upper
layers and how this UE configuration is achieved is implementation
specific.

In the PDN type IE the UE shall either indicate the IP version
capability of the IP stack associated with the UE or non IP or Ethernet
as specified in clause 6.2.2.

If the PDN type value of the PDN type IE is set to IPv4 or IPv6 or
IPv4v6 and the UE indicates "Control plane CIoT EPS optimization
supported" in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST
message, the UE may include the Header compression configuration IE in
the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

When the connectivity to a PDN is to be transferred from a non-3GPP
access network to the 3GPP access network, the UE shall set the PDN type
value of the PDN type IE to:

- IPv4, if the previously allocated home address information consists of
an IPv4 address only;

- IPv6, if the previously allocated home address information consists of
an IPv6 prefix only; or

- IPv4v6, if the previously allocated home address information consists
of both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix.

The UE shall set the request type to "initial request" when the UE is
establishing a new PDN connectivity to a PDN in an attach procedure or
in a stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure or when the UE requests
establishment of a PDN connection as a user-plane resource of an MA PDU
session to be established. The UE shall set the request type to
"emergency" when the UE is requesting a new PDN connectivity for
emergency bearer services. The UE shall set the request type to
"handover" when the connectivity to a PDN is to be transferred from a
non-3GPP access network to the 3GPP access network, when the UE
initiates the procedure to add 3GPP access to the PDN connection which
is already established over WLAN, when the UE supporting N1 mode
requests transfer of an existing non-emergency PDU session in 5GS or
when the UE requests establishment of a PDN connection as a user-plane
resource of an already established MA PDU session. The UE shall set the
request type to "handover of emergency bearer services" when a PDN
connection for emergency bearer services is to be transferred from a
WLAN to the 3GPP access network or when the UE supporting N1 mode
requests transfer of an existing emergency PDU session in 5GS. The UE
shall set the request type to "RLOS" when the UE is requesting a new PDN
connection for RLOS.

If the UE supports DSMIPv6, the UE may include a request for obtaining
the IPv6 address and optionally the IPv4 address of the home agent in
the Protocol configuration options IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message. The UE may also include a request for obtaining the IPv6 Home
Network Prefix. The UE shall request the IPv6 Home Network Prefix only
if the UE has requested the home agent IPv6 address. The requested home
agent address(es) and the Home Network Prefix are related to the APN the
UE requested connectivity for.

The UE may set the ESM information transfer flag in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message to indicate that it has ESM information, i.e. protocol
configuration options, APN, or both, that needs to be sent after the NAS
signalling security has been activated between the UE and the MME.

If the UE supports A/Gb mode or Iu mode or both, the UE shall indicate
the support of the network requested bearer control procedures (see
3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) in A/Gb mode or Iu mode in the Protocol
configuration options IE.

If the UE supports N1 mode and the request type is:

a) "initial request" or "emergency", the UE shall generate a PDU session
ID, associate the PDU session ID with the PDN connection that is being
established, and include the PDU session ID in the Protocol
configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options
IE;

b) "handover" or "handover of emergency bearer services", and the UE
requests:

1) transfer of an existing PDU session in 5GS or establishment of a PDN
connection as a user-plane resource of an already established MA PDU
session, the UE shall associate the PDU session ID of the PDU session
with the PDN connection that is being established for the existing PDU
session and include the PDU session ID in the Protocol configuration
options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options IE; or

2) transfer of an existing PDN connection in a non-3GPP access connected
to the EPC and a PDU session ID is associated with the existing PDN
connection, the UE shall include the PDU session ID in the Protocol
configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options
IE and associate the PDU session ID with the PDN connection that is
being established. If the existing PDN connection is a non-emergency PDN
connection and an S-NSSAI and a related PLMN ID are associated with the
existing PDN connection, the UE shall in addition associate the S-NSSAI
and the related PLMN ID with the PDN connection that is being
established.

NOTE 4: The UE can also have an S-NSSAI and the related PLMN ID
associated with the PDN connection, if the S-NSSAI and the related PLMN
ID was associated with the existing PDN connection in a non-3GPP access
connected to the EPC as specified in 3GPP TS 24.302 [48]. The UE stores
this S-NSSAI and the related PLMN ID for later use during inter-system
change from S1 mode to N1 mode.

If the N1 mode capability is disabled, the UE may apply a) and b.2)
above for service continuity support at inter-system change from S1 mode
to N1 mode once its N1 mode capability is enabled again.

If the UE supporting N1 mode supports receiving QoS rules with the
length of two octets or QoS flow descriptions with the length of two
octets via the Extended protocol configuration options IE, the UE shall
include the QoS rules with the length of two octets support indicator or
the QoS flow descriptions with the length of two octets support
indicator, respectively, in the Protocol configuration options IE or the
Extended protocol configuration options IE.

If the UE supports providing PDU session ID in the Protocol
configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options
IE when its N1 mode capability is disabled, the UE shall include the QoS
rules with the length of two octets support indicator or the QoS flow
descriptions with the length of two octets support indicator,
respectively, in the Protocol configuration options IE or the Extended
protocol configuration options IE.

Protocol configuration options provided in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE
message replace any protocol configuration options provided in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

When the UE initiates the procedure to add 3GPP access to the PDN
connection that is already established over WLAN, the UE shall provide
the same APN as that of the PDN connection established over WLAN in the
PDN connectivity procedure as specified in the clause 6.2.2 of
3GPP TS 23.161 [34].

If the UE supports APN rate control, the UE shall include an APN rate
control support indicator and an additional APN rate control for
exception data support indicator in the Protocol configuration options
IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE.

If the UE supports DNS over (D)TLS (see 3GPP TS 33.501 [24]), the UE
shall include the Protocol configuration options IE or the Extended
protocol configuration options IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or ESM
INFORMATION RESPONSE message and include the DNS server security
information indicator and optionally, if the UE wishes to indicate which
security protocol type(s) are supported by the UE, it may include the
DNS server security protocol support.

NOTE 5: Support of DNS over (D)TLS is based on the informative
requirements as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 [24].

When the UE supporting UAS services initiates a UE requested PDN
connectivity procedure for UAS services during an attach procedure, the
UE:

a) shall create the service-level-AA container with the length of two
octets. In the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets,
the UE:

1) shall include the service-level device ID parameter set to the UE's
CAA-level UAV ID;

2) shall include the service-level-AA server address parameter set to
the USS address, if it is provided by the upper layers;

3) shall include the service-level-AA payload parameter set to the UUAA
payload and the service-level-AA payload type parameter set to "UUAA
payload", if the UUAA payload is provided by the upper layer; and

4) shall include the service-level-AA payload parameter set to the C2
authorization payload and the service-level-AA payload type parameter
set to "C2 authorization payload", if the C2 authorization procedure is
requested; and

NOTE 6: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload
parameter can include one, some or all of the pairing information for C2
communication, an indication of the request for direct C2 communication,
pairing information for direct C2 communication and the flight
authorization information.

b) shall include the created service-level-AA container with the length
of two octets in the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message.

When the UE supporting UAS services initiates a UE requested PDN
connectivity procedure for C2 communication after the completion of the
attach procedure, the UE:

a) shall create the service-level-AA container with the length of two
octets. In the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets,
the UE:

1) shall include the service-level device ID parameter set to the UE's
CAA-level UAV ID; and

2) shall include the service-level-AA payload parameter set to the C2
authorization payload and the service-level-AA payload type parameter
set to "C2 authorization payload"; and

NOTE 7: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload
parameter can include one, some or all of the pairing information for C2
communication, an indication of the request for direct C2 communication,
pairing information for direct C2 communication and the flight
authorization information.

b) shall include the created service-level-AA container with the length
of two octets in the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

If the UE supports provisioning of ECS configuration information to the
EEC in the UE, then the UE may include the ECS configuration information
provisioning support indicator in the Protocol configuration options IE
or the Extended protocol configuration options IE in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

If the UE supports secondary DN authentication and authorization over
EPC and has included the PDU session ID in the Protocol configuration
options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options IE, the UE
shall include the SDNAEPC support indicator in the Protocol
configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options
IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, and if the UE requests to
establish a new non-emergency PDN connection with a DN, the UE may
include the SDNAEPC DN-specific identity set to DN-specific identity of
the UE complying with network access identifier (NAI) format as
specified in IETF RFC 7542 [62] in the Protocol configuration options IE
or the Extended protocol configuration options IE in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

NOTE 8: The UE can avoid including both the SDNAEPC DN-specific identity
and the protocol configuration option parameters with PAP/CHAP protocol
identifiers in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. The way to achieve
this is implementation dependent.

If the UE supports URSP provisioning in EPS and the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message is sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST message, then
the UE shall include the Protocol configuration options IE or the
Extended protocol configuration options IE according to
subclause 6.6.1.1 in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or ESM INFORMATION
RESPONSE message and shall include the URSP provisioning in EPS support
indicator.

If the UE supports URSP provisioning in EPS, the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message was not sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST message,
the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure is performed for the first
PDN connection, and the MME supports the Extended protocol configuration
options IE then the UE shall include the Protocol configuration options
IE or the Extended protocol configuration options IE according to
subclause 6.6.1.1 in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and shall
include the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator.

[]

Figure 6.5.1.2.1: UE requested PDN connectivity procedure

6.5.1.3 UE requested PDN connectivity procedure accepted by the network

Upon receipt of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the MME checks
whether the ESM information transfer flag is included. If the flag is
included the MME waits for completion of the ESM information request
procedure before proceeding with the PDN connectivity procedure. The MME
then checks if connectivity with the requested PDN can be established.
If no requested APN is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
or the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message and the request type is
different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services" and from "RLOS", the MME shall use the default APN as the
requested APN. If the request type is "emergency" or "handover of
emergency bearer services", the MME shall use the APN configured for
emergency bearer services or select the statically configured PDN GW for
unauthenticated UEs, if applicable. If the request type is "RLOS", the
MME shall use the APN configured for RLOS.

If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same
combination of APN and PDN type as an already existing PDN connection,
and multiple PDN connections for a given APN are allowed, the network
retains the existing EPS bearer contexts for the PDN connection and
proceeds with the requested PDN connectivity procedure.

If the lower layers provide a GW Transport Layer Address value
identifying a L-GW together with the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
and a PDN connection is established as a LIPA PDN connection due to the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, then the MME shall store the GW
Transport Layer Address value as the P-GW address in the EPS bearer
context of the LIPA PDN connection.

If the lower layers provide a SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address value
identifying a L-GW together with the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
and a PDN connection is established as a SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection due to the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, then the MME
shall store the SIPTO L-GW Transport Layer Address value as the P-GW
address in the EPS bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN
connection.

If the lower layers provide a LHN-ID value together with the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and a PDN connection is established as a
SIPTO at the local network PDN connection due to the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message, then the MME shall store the LHN-ID value in the EPS
bearer context of the SIPTO at the local network PDN connection.

NOTE 1: The receipt of a LHN-ID value during the establishment of the
PDN connection, during tracking area updating procedure or during
inter-MME handover can be used as an indication by the MME that the
SIPTO at the local network PDN connection is established to a
stand-alone GW (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [10]).

If connectivity with the requested PDN is accepted by the network, the
MME shall initiate the default EPS bearer context activation procedure
(see clause 6.4.1).

If connectivity with the requested PDN is accepted and the network
considers this PDN connection a LIPA PDN connection, then subject to
operator policy the MME shall include in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message the Connectivity type IE indicating "the PDN
connection is considered a LIPA PDN connection".

If connectivity with the requested PDN is accepted, but with a
restriction of IP version (i.e. both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix
is requested, but only one particular IP version, or only single IP
version bearers are supported/allowed by the network), ESM cause #50
"PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", or #52
"single address bearers only allowed", respectively, shall be included
in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.

If connectivity with the requested PDN is accepted and the UE provided
the Header compression configuration IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message, the MME may include the Header compression configuration IE in
the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message. Furthermore, if
the MME decides that the associated PDN connection is only for control
plane CIoT EPS optimization (see clause 5.3.15), the MME shall include
the Control plane only indication in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
the UE shall stop timer T3482 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION
INACTIVE. The UE should ensure that the procedure transaction identity
(PTI) assigned to this procedure is not released immediately. The way to
achieve this is implementation dependent. While the PTI value is not
released, the UE regards any received ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same PTI value as a network
retransmission (see clause 7.3.1).

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
with the Connectivity type IE indicating "the PDN connection is
considered a LIPA PDN connection", the UE provides an indication to the
upper layers that the connectivity is provided by a LIPA PDN connection.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
if the 3GPP PS data off UE status is "activated", the UE behaves as
described in clause 6.3.10.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
if the SCEF or P-GW indicates acceptance of use of Reliable Data Service
to transfer data for the PDN connection, the UE behaves as described in
clause 6.3.11.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message,
if an S-NSSAI and the PLMN ID that this S-NSSAI relates to are provided
in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol
configuration options IE, the UE shall delete the stored S-NSSAI and the
PLMN ID that this S-NSSAI relates to, if any, and shall store the
S-NSSAI and the PLMN ID this S-NSSAI relates to provided in the ACTIVATE
DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and the associated PLMN ID
along with the corresponding PDU session ID that the UE provided in the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. The usage of the PDU session ID and
the corresponding S-NSSAI with the associated PLMN ID is specified in
3GPP TS 24.501 [54]. Additionally, the UE shall remove the S-NSSAI, if
present, from the rejected NSSAI as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
clause 4.6.2.2.

Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
with a session-AMBR and QoS rule(s), which correspond to the default EPS
bearer of the PDN connectivity being activated, in the Protocol
configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options
IE, the UE stores the session-AMBR and QoS rule(s) for use during
inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode.

If the UE requests the PDN type "IPv4v6", receives the selected PDN type
set to "IPv4" and the ESM cause value #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed",
the UE shall not automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message to the same APN (or no APN, if no APN was indicated by the UE)
to obtain a PDN type different from the one allowed by the network
until:

- the UE is registered to a new PLMN;

- the UE is switched off; or

- the USIM is removed.

If the UE requests the PDN type "IPv4v6", receives the selected PDN type
set to "IPv6" and the ESM cause value #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed",
the UE shall not automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message to the same APN (or no APN, if no APN was indicated by the UE)
to obtain a PDN type different from the one allowed by the network
until:

- the UE is registered to a new PLMN;

- the UE is switched off; or

- the USIM is removed.

NOTE 2: For the ESM cause values #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed" and
#51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", re-attempt in A/Gb, Iu, or N1 mode for
the same APN (or no APN, if no APN was indicated by the UE) is only
allowed using the PDN type(s) indicated by the network.

6.5.1.4 UE requested PDN connectivity procedure not accepted by the network

6.5.1.4.1 General

If connectivity with the requested PDN cannot be accepted by the
network, the MME shall send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message to the UE.
The message shall contain the PTI and an ESM cause value indicating the
reason for rejecting the UE requested PDN connectivity.

The ESM cause IE typically indicates one of the following ESM cause
values:

#8: operator determined barring;

#26: insufficient resources;

#27: missing or unknown APN;

#28: unknown PDN type;

#29: user authentication or authorization failed;

#30: request rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW;

#31: request rejected, unspecified;

#32: service option not supported;

#33: requested service option not subscribed;

#34: service option temporarily out of order;

#35: PTI already in use;

#38: network failure;

#50: PDN type IPv4 only allowed;

#51: PDN type IPv6 only allowed;

#53: ESM information not received;

#54: PDN connection does not exist;

#55: multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed;

#57: PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed;

#58: PDN type non IP only allowed;

#61: PDN type Ethernet only allowed;

#65: maximum number of EPS bearers reached;

#66: requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination;

#95 – 111: protocol errors;

#112: APN restriction value incompatible with active EPS bearer context;

#113: Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed.

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REJECT message. If the ESM cause value is #26 "insufficient
resources" and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was received via a
NAS signalling connection established with RRC establishment cause "High
priority access AC 11 – 15" or the request type in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message was set to "emergency" or "handover of emergency bearer
services", the network shall not include a Back-off timer value IE.

If the ESM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources",
#28 "unknown PDN type", #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type
IPv6 only allowed", #54 "PDN connection does not exist", #57 "PDN type
IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDN type non IP only allowed", #61 "PDN type
Ethernet only allowed", #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached", and
#66 "requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination",
and the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was received via a NAS
signalling connection established with RRC establishment cause "High
priority access AC 11 – 15", the network shall not include a Back-off
timer value IE.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the ESM cause value is
different from #26 "insufficient resources", #50 "PDN type IPv4 only
allowed", #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type IPv4v6 only
allowed", #58 "PDN type non IP only allowed", #61 "PDN type Ethernet
only allowed", and #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached", the
network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE to indicate:

- whether the UE is allowed to attempt a PDP context activation
procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU
session establishment procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in N1 mode;
and

- whether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode, in S1 mode or in N1 mode
is allowed in an equivalent PLMN.

If the ESM cause value is #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN
type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDN
type non IP only allowed" or #61 "PDN type Ethernet only allowed", the
network may include the Re-attempt indicator IE without Back-off timer
value IE to indicate whether the UE is allowed to attempt a PDN
connectivity procedure in an equivalent PLMN for the same APN in S1 mode
using the same PDN type.

If the ESM cause value is #66 "requested APN not supported in current
RAT and PLMN combination", the network may include the Re-attempt
indicator IE without Back-off timer value IE to indicate whether the UE
is allowed to attempt a PDN connectivity procedure in an equivalent PLMN
for the same APN in S1 mode.

Upon receipt of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message, the UE shall stop
timer T3482 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message is due to an ESM failure notified
by EMM layer (i.e., EMM cause #19 "ESM failure" included in an ATTACH
REJECT message), the UE may include a different APN in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

NOTE 1: When receiving EMM cause #19 "ESM failure", coordination is
required between the EMM and ESM sublayers in the UE to notify the ESM
failure.

If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent with request type set
to "emergency" or "handover of emergency bearer services" in a
stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure and the UE receives a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REJECT message, then the UE may:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure to establish the emergency
bearer; or

NOTE 2: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of
a CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain) or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for
emergency bearer services.

If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent with PDN type set to
"Ethernet" and the UE receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message with
ESM cause #58 "PDN type non IP only allowed", then the UE may attempt a
PDN connectivity procedure with the non-IP PDN type.

If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message contains the UAS services not
allowed indication in the Extended protocol configuration options IE and
the UE has not provided its CAA-level UAV ID to the network, the UE
shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for UAS services
without providing its CAA-level UAV ID to the network.

NOTE 3: If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message contains the UAS services
not allowed indication in the Extended protocol configuration options
IE, the ESM cause value #29 "user authentication or authorization
failed" is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message.

NOTE 4: The PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message contains the UAS services
not allowed indication included in the Extended protocol configuration
options IE, if the PDN connection is identified to be for UAS services
based on the APN, and the CAA-level UAV ID is not provided by the UE in
the request, or if the network is informed by the UAS NF that the UAS
service is not allowed.

NOTE 5: If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message does not contain the
SDNAEPC support indicator in the Protocol configuration options IE or
the Extended protocol configuration options IE and the secondary DN
authentication and authorization over EPC is mandatory due to local
policies, the ESM cause value #29 "user authentication or authorization
failed" can be included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message".

6.5.1.4.2 Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause #26

If the ESM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off
timer value IE is included, the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator
IE provided by the network, if any, and behave as follows:

1) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the UE
shall take different actions depending on the timer value received for
timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is configured for
dual priority, exceptions are specified in clause 6.5.5; if the UE is a
UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are
specified in clause 6.3.5):

i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an APN
was included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the UE shall stop
timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if it is running. If
the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, no APN was
included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and the request type
was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is
running. The UE shall then start timer T3396 with the value provided in
the Back-off timer value IE and:

- shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
same APN that was sent by the UE, until timer T3396 expires or timer
T3396 is stopped; and

- shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN
and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST with exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST for a non-emergency PDN connection
established without an APN provided by the UE, if no APN was included in
the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and the request type was different
from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", until
timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped.

The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE:

- shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE
receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE
DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message for the same APN from the network or a DEACTIVATE EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation
requested" for a default EPS bearer context for the same APN from the
network; and

- shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN
and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST with exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection
established without an APN provided by the UE, if no APN was included in
the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and the request type was different
from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", until
the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for
a non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by
the UE, or a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM
cause #39 "reactivation requested" for a default EPS bearer context of a
non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the
UE.

The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change; and

iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

- shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if
running, and may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for
the same APN; and

- if no APN was included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and the
request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated
with no APN, if running, and may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message without an APN, or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN
connection established without an APN provided by the UE; and

2) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an
ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall take different actions depending on the
timer value received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value IE and
on the integrity protection of the ATTACH REJECT message (if the UE is
configured for dual priority, exceptions are specified in clause 6.5.5;
if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN,
exceptions are specified in clause 6.3.5):

i) if the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected and an APN
was sent by the UE during the attach procedure, the UE shall stop timer
T3396 associated with the corresponding APN if it is running. If the
ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, the request type was
different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", and an APN was not sent by the UE, the UE shall stop timer
T3396 associated with no APN if it is running. The UE shall then start
timer T3396 with a random value from a default range specified in
table 11.2.3 defined in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], and:

a) shall not initiate a new attach procedure with the same APN or send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST with the same APN that was sent by the
UE, until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped; and

b) shall not initiate a new attach procedure without an APN and with
request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
bearer services" or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without an APN
and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the
attach procedure and the request type was different from "emergency" and
from "handover of emergency bearer services", until timer T3396 expires.

The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

ii) if the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall
proceed as follows:

a) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated and an APN
was sent by the UE during the attach procedure, the UE shall stop timer
T3396 associated with the corresponding APN if it is running. If the
timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the request type was
different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", and an APN was not sent by the UE during the attach
procedure, the UE shall stop timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is
running. The UE shall then start timer T3396 with the value provided in
the Back-off timer value IE and:

- shall not initiate a new attach procedure with the same APN or send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST with the same APN that was sent by the
UE, until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped; and

- shall not initiate a new attach procedure without an APN and with
request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
bearer services" or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without an APN
and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the
attach procedure and the request type was different from "emergency" and
from "handover of emergency bearer services", until timer T3396 expires.

The UE shall not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change;

b) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE:

- shall not initiate a new attach procedure with the same APN or send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST with the same APN that was sent by the
UE, until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed, or the UE
receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for the
same APN from the network; and

- shall not initiate a new attach procedure without an APN and with
request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
bearer services" or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without an APN
and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the
attach procedure and the request type was different from "emergency" and
from "handover of emergency bearer services", until the UE is switched
off or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection
established without an APN provided by the UE.

The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or inter-system
change; and

c) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE shall
proceed as specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6 item d.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST was sent standalone, then the UE may send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN.

When the timer T3396 is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE is
allowed to initiate an attach procedure or PDN connectivity procedure if
the procedure is for emergency bearer services.

If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE shall
behave as follows:

- let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1;

- if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running for a specific APN,
because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message containing the low
priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer
T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE configured for dual
priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in
clause 6.5.5; and

- if prior to switch off timer T3396 was running because a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST
message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured
for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for
timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE
configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as
indicated in clause 6.5.5.

6.5.1.4.3 Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause other than ESM cause #26

If the ESM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources",
#28 "unknown PDN type", #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type
IPv6 only allowed", #54 "PDN connection does not exist", #57 "PDN type
IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDN type non IP only allowed", #61 "PDN type
Ethernet only allowed", #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached", and
#66 "requested APN not supported in current RAT and PLMN combination",
and the Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall behave as
follows:

1) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the UE
shall take different actions depending on the timer value received in
the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 –
15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in clause 6.3.6):

i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall start the back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off
timer value IE for the PDN connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN
combination, and the UE:

- shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN
for the same APN that was sent by the UE, until the back-off timer
expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

- shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN
without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from
"handover of emergency bearer services" if no APN was included in the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, until the back-off timer expires, the
UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE:

- shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN
for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;
and

- shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN
without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from
"handover of emergency bearer services" if no APN was included in the
PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, until the UE is switched off or the
USIM is removed; and

iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

- may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN for the
same APN; and

- may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN without
an APN; and

2) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an
ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall take different actions depending on the
timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE and on the integrity
protection of the ATTACH REJECT message (if the UE is a UE configured to
use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in
clause 6.3.6):

i) if the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, the UE shall
start the back-off timer with a random value from a default range
specified in table 11.2.3(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]), and the UE:

a) shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN with the same APN that was sent
by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or
the USIM is removed; and

b) shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN without an APN and with request
type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the attach procedure
and the request type was different from "emergency", until the back-off
timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

ii) if the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall
proceed as follows:

a) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall start the back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off
timer value IE for the PDN connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN
combination, and the UE:

- shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN with the same APN that was sent
by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or
the USIM is removed; and

- shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN without an APN and with request
type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the attach procedure
and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover
of emergency bearer services", until the back-off timer expires, the UE
is switched off or the USIM is removed;

b) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE:

- shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN with the same APN that was sent
by the UE, until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

- shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the PLMN without an APN and with request
type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", if the UE did not provide any APN during the attach procedure
and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover
of emergency bearer services", until the UE is switched off or the USIM
is removed; and

c) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE shall
proceed as specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6 item d.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST was sent standalone, then the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt
indicator IE provided by the network in PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT, if any.

1) Additionally, if the ESM cause value is #8 "operator determined
barring", #27 "missing or unknown APN", #32 "service option not
supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the UE
shall proceed as follows:

- if the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the
EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall behave as
described above in the present clause, using the configured
SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM
file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, as
back-off timer value; and

NOTE 0: The way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryWaitTime values
for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is
configured with:
- an SM_RetryWaitTime value in ME as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A];
and
- an SM_RetryWaitTime value in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

- otherwise, if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that
is within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), or if the
SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as
described above in the present clause, using the default value of 12
minutes for the back-off timer.

2) For ESM cause values different from #8 "operator determined barring",
#27 "missing or unknown APN", #32 "service option not supported", or #33
"requested service option not subscribed", the UE behaviour regarding
the start of a back-off timer is unspecified.

The UE shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or
inter-system change. If the network indicates that a back-off timer for
the PDN connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN combination is
deactivated, then it remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or
inter-system change.

NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be
deactivated for the given ESM procedure and PLMN and APN combination
when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change
back from A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode to S1 mode. Thus the UE can still
be prevented from sending another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in
the PLMN for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included and the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST was sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall ignore
the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network in PDN CONNECTIVITY
REJECT, if any, and proceed as specified in clause 5.5.1.2.6, item d.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REJECT (i.e. the timer value was provided by the network, a configured
value is available or the default value is used as explained above) or
the back-off timer is deactivated, the UE behaves as follows:

1) after a PLMN change the UE may send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message for the same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer is not
running and is not deactivated for the PDN connectivity procedure and
the combination of new PLMN and APN.

Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #8
"operator determined barring", #27 "missing or unknown APN", #32
"service option not supported" or #33 "requested service option not
subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE,
the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE using the same
PDN type, or the UE may decide not to automatically send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message included in an ATTACH REQUEST message
without an APN using the same PDN type if the UE did not provide any APN
in the PDN connectivity procedure, if the UE is registered to a new PLMN
which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs;

2) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to
indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, or
the UE ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off
timer value IE is not included, then:

- if the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the
EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall apply the
configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, to determine whether the UE may
attempt a PDP context activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN
combination in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU session establishment procedure
for the same PLMN and APN combination in N1 mode; and

NOTE 2: The way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange
values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is
configured with:

- an SM_RetryAtRATChange value in ME as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]; and

- an SM_RetryAtRATChange value in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

- if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within
the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), or if the NAS
configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] is not available
and the value for inter-system change is not configured in the USIM file
NAS_(CONFIG), then the UE behaviour regarding a PDP context activation
procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode and a
PDU session establishment procedure for the same PLMN and APN
combination in N1 mode are unspecified; and

3) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that
re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then depending on the
timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each
combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE
shall start a back-off timer for the PDN connectivity procedure with the
value provided by the network, or deactivate the respective back-off
timer as follows:

- if the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt
in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, the UE shall start or
deactivate the back-off timer for S1 mode only; and

- otherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for
A/Gb, Iu, S1 and N1 mode.

If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or
deactivated in A/Gb or Iu mode upon receipt of an ACTIVATE PDP CONTEXT
REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) and the network indicated that
re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not
prevent the UE from sending a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this
PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the
network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE
shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the
same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires,
the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

If a back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination, in combination with
any S-NSSAI or without S-NSSAI (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) was started or
deactivated in N1 mode upon receipt of a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT
REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) and the network indicated that
re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not
prevent the UE from sending a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this
PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the
network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE
shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the
same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer expires,
the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If more than one back-off
timers for the same PLMN and APN combination was started in N1 mode with
an indication from the network that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed
and no back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was
deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change
to S1 mode until all timers have expired. If at least one back-off timer
for the same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE
shall not send any PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in this PLMN for the
same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

NOTE 3: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the
required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific
implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

NOTE 4: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to
use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer
within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to
UE implementation. This back-off timer is stopped when the UE is
switched off or the USIM is removed.

When the back-off timer is running or the timer is deactivated, the UE
is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or PDN connectivity procedure
if the procedure is for emergency bearer services.

If the ESM cause value is #28 "unknown PDN type" and the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message contained a PDN type IE indicating a PDN
connection type, the UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and
Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any. The UE may send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the PDN type IE indicating
another PDN connection type.

If the ESM cause value is #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN
type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDN
type non IP only allowed" or #61 "PDN type Ethernet only allowed", the
UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE provided by the network, if
any. The UE shall not automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE to obtain a PDN
type different from the one allowed by the network until any of the
following conditions is fulfilled:

- the UE is registered to a new PLMN, and either the network did not
include a Re-attempt indicator IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message
or the Re-attempt indicator IE included in the message indicated that
re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed;

- the UE is registered to a new PLMN which was not in the list of
equivalent PLMNs at the time when the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message
was received;

- the UE is switched off; or

- the USIM is removed.

For the ESM cause values #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type
IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDN type
non IP only allowed" and #61 "PDN type Ethernet only allowed", the UE
shall ignore the value of the RATC bit in the Re-attempt indicator IE
provided by the network, if any.

NOTE 5: For the ESM cause values #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51
"PDN type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN type IPv4v6 only allowed", #58
"PDN type non IP only allowed" and #61 "PDN type Ethernet only allowed",
re-attempt in A/Gb, Iu, or N1 mode for the same APN (or no APN, if no
APN was indicated by the UE) is only allowed using the PDN type(s)
indicated by the network.

Furthermore as an implementation option, for the SM cause values #50
"PDN type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", #57 "PDN
type IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDN type non IP only allowed" and #61
"PDN type Ethernet only allowed", if the network does not include a
Re-attempt indicator IE the UE may decide not to automatically send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent
by the UE using the same PDN type, if the UE is registered to a new PLMN
which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

NOTE 6: Request to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a
specific PDN type has to come from upper layers.

If the ESM cause value is #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached",
the UE shall determine the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts
in S1 mode (see clause 6.5.0) as the number of active EPS bearer
contexts it has. The UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and
Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

NOTE 7: In some situations, when attempting to establish multiple EPS
bearer contexts, the number of active EPS bearer contexts that the UE
has when ESM cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum number of
EPS bearer contexts reached in the network.

NOTE 8: When the network supports emergency bearer services, it is not
expected that ESM cause #65 is returned by the network when the UE
requests a PDN connection for emergency bearer services.

The PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode applies to
the PLMN in which the ESM cause #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers
reached" is received. When the UE is switched off, when the USIM is
removed, or when there is a change in the value indicated by the network
in the 15 bearers bit of the EPS network feature support IE, the UE
shall clear all previous determinations representing PLMNs maximum
number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode. Upon successful registration
with a new PLMN, the UE may clear previous determinations representing
any PLMN's maximum number(s) of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode.

If the ESM cause value is #66 "requested APN not supported in current
RAT and PLMN combination", the UE shall take different actions depending
on the Back-off timer value IE and the Re-attempt indicator IE
optionally included:

1) If the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the
Back-off timer value IE is not included, and either the Re-attempt
indicator IE is not included or the Re-attempt indicator IE is included
indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed, the UE
shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN
in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM
is removed;

2) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the
Back-off timer value IE is not included, and the Re-attempt indicator IE
is included and indicates that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not
allowed, the UE shall not send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for
the same APN in any PLMN in the list of equivalent PLMNs in S1 mode
until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

3) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone and the
Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall take different actions
depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE (if
the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions
are specified in clause 6.3.6):

i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall start the back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off
timer value IE for the PLMN and APN combination and shall not send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST for the same APN in the current PLMN in
S1 mode until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the
USIM is removed;

ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE
shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN
in the current PLMN in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM
is removed; and

iii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is zero, the UE may
send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the current
PLMN; and

4) if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an
ATTACH REQUEST, the UE shall take different actions depending on the
integrity protection of the ATTACH REJECT message (if the UE is a UE
configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified
in clause 6.3.6):

i) if the ATTACH REJECT message is not integrity protected, regardless
whether the Back-off timer IE is included, the UE shall start the
back-off timer with a random value from a default range specified in
table 11.2.3(see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]), and shall not initiate a new
attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in the
current PLMN in S1 mode with the same APN that was sent by the UE, until
the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is
removed; and

ii) if the ATTACH REJECT message is integrity protected, the UE shall
proceed as follows:

a) if the Back-off timer value IE is included and the timer value
indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE shall start the back-off
timer with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE for the PDN
connectivity procedure and PLMN and APN combination and shall not
initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message in the current PLMN in S1 mode with the same APN that was sent
by the UE, until the back-off timer expires, the UE is switched off or
the USIM is removed;

b) if the Back-off timer value IE is included and the timer value
indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE shall not initiate a
new attach procedure or send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message in
the current PLMN in S1 mode with the same APN that was sent by the UE,
until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

c) if the Back-off timer value IE is included and the timer value
indicates that this timer is zero, the UE shall proceed as specified in
clause 5.5.1.2.6 item d;

d) if the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and either the
Re-attempt indicator IE is not included or the Re-attempt indicator IE
is included indicating that re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is allowed,
the UE shall not initiate a new attach procedure or send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in the current PLMN in S1
mode until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

e) if the Back-off timer value IE is not included, and the Re-attempt
indicator IE is included and indicates that re-attempt in an equivalent
PLMN is not allowed, the UE shall not initiate a new attach procedure or
send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for the same APN in any PLMN in
the list of equivalent PLMNs in S1 mode until the UE is switched off or
the USIM is removed.

NOTE 9: Receiving ESM cause value #66 during an attach procedure without
APN is not expected and the UE behaviour is implementation specific.

If the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that
re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then:

- for cases 3.i, 4.i and 4.ii.a the UE shall additionally start a
back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off timer value IE
for the PDN connectivity procedure for each combination of a PLMN from
the equivalent PLMN list and the APN; and

- for cases 3.ii and 4.ii.b the UE shall deactivate the respective
back-off timers for the PDN connectivity procedure for each combination
of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN.

For the ESM cause value #66 "requested APN not supported in current RAT
and PLMN combination" the UE shall ignore the value of the RATC bit in
the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

As an implementation option, for cases 1, 3.i, 3.ii, 4.iv, 4.v.a and
4.v.b, if the Re-attempt indicator IE is not included, the UE may decide
not to automatically send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for
the same APN in a PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.

If the ESM cause value is #54 "PDN connection does not exist", the UE
shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and Re-attempt indicator IE
provided by the network, if any, and take different actions as follows:

- if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent standalone, the UE
shall set the request type to "initial request" in the subsequent PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to establish a PDN connectivity to the same
APN;

- if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent together with an
ATTACH REQUEST message, the UE shall set the request type to "initial
request" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message which is included in
the subsequent ATTACH REQUEST message to establish a PDN connectivity to
the same APN.

NOTE 10: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot
re-activate the EPS bearer context(s) automatically.

If the PDN connection is for UAS services, and the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REJECT message includes the Extended protocol configuration options IE
containing the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets
, and the service-level-AA container with the length of two octets
contains the service-level-AA response parameter with the SLAR field set
to "Service level authentication and authorization was not successful or
service level authorization is revoked", then the UE supporting UAS
services shall consider the UUAA procedure as failed and not attempt to
establish a PDN connection for UAS services.

6.5.1.4A Handling the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts

If the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts is reached at the UE
(see clause 6.5.0) and the upper layers of the UE request connectivity
to a PDN the UE shall not send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message unless
an active EPS bearer is deactivated. If the UE needs to de-activate an
active EPS bearer context, choosing which EPS bearer context to
de-activate is implementation specific, however the UE shall not
deactivate an EPS bearer context for emergency.

NOTE: Clause 6.5.1.6 specifies that a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
with the same combination of APN and PDN type as an already existing,
non-emergency PDN connection can be acceptable, in some cases. In these
cases the UE does not need to de-activate an active EPS bearer context
if the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts is reached at the
UE.

If the UE needs to de-activate an EPS bearer context in order to request
an emergency EPS bearer context, it shall either de-activate an EPS
bearer context locally or via explicit signalling. If the UE performs
local de-activation, the UE shall perform tracking area updating
procedure to indicate EPS bearer context status to the network.

6.5.1.4B Void

6.5.1.4C Handling the maximum number of active user plane radio bearers in NB-S1 mode

When the maximum number of active user plane radio bearers in NB-S1 mode
is reached (see clause 6.5.0) and upper layers request for more DRBs for
PDN connections other than PDN connections with those DRBs, the UE can
choose to release one or more of the PDN connections to cater for the
upper layer request. The choice of which PDN connection to be released
is implementation specific.

If the maximum number of active user plane radio bearers in NB-S1 mode
is reached and the upper layers of the UE request user-plane resources
for exception data reporting, the UE shall release a PDN connection that
has user-plane resources to cater for the request for exception data
reporting. The choice of which PDN connection to be released is
implementation specific.

If the UE needs to release a PDN connection for the reasons stated in
this clause, a PDN connection that is used for exception data reporting
shall not be released.

If the UE releases a PDN connection to cater for the upper layer
request, the UE shall release the PDN connection via explicit ESM
signalling.

6.5.1.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) T3482 expired

On the first expiry of the timer T3482:

- if the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was sent with request type set
to "emergency" or "handover of emergency bearer services" in a
stand-alone PDN connectivity procedure, then the UE shall:

a) inform the upper layers of the failure to establish the emergency
bearer; or

NOTE: This can result in the upper layers requesting establishment of a
CS emergency call (if not already attempted in the CS domain), or other
implementation specific mechanisms, e.g. procedures specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [13D] can result in the emergency call being attempted to
another IP-CAN.

b) detach locally, if not detached already, attempt EPS attach for
emergency bearer services.

- otherwise, the UE shall resend the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST and shall
reset and restart timer T3482. This retransmission is repeated four
times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3482, the UE shall abort the
procedure, release the PTI allocated for this invocation and enter the
state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

b) T3447 is running

The UE shall not send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message when the UE is
in EMM-CONNECTED mode after the UE attached without PDN connection,
unless:

- establishment of a PDN connection for emergency bearer services is
requested;

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in the selected PLMN; or

- a network initiated signalling message has been received.

The PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message can be sent, if still necessary,
when timer T3447 expires.

c) Collision of UE requested PDN connectivity procedure and NAS
signalling connection release

The UE may immediately retransmit the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
and stop, reset and restart timer T3482, if the following conditions
apply:

1) the original UE requested PDN connectivity procedure was initiated
over an existing NAS signalling connection; and

2) the previous transmission of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message was
not initiated due to timer T3482 expiry.

6.5.1.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) UE initiated PDN connectivity request for an already existing PDN
connection:

If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same
combination of APN and PDN type as an already existing PDN connection
and:

- the information elements in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message do
not differ from the ones received within the previous PDN CONNECTIVITY
REQUEST message, and the MME has not received the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message from UE, the network shall resend the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and continue the
previous procedure.

- one or more information elements in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message differ from the ones received within the previous PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, and multiple PDN connections for a given
APN are not allowed, the network may deactivate the existing EPS bearer
contexts for the PDN connection locally without notification to the UE
and proceed with the requested PDN connectivity procedure or may reject
this PDN connectivity procedure including the ESM cause #55 "multiple
PDN connections for a given APN not allowed", in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REJECT message.

If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request
type "emergency" and the MME has not received the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message from UE for the previous PDN connectivity
request for emergency bearer services, the network shall resend the
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and continue the
previous procedure. If there is already a PDN connection for emergency
bearer services existing, the MME shall reject the request with ESM
cause #55 "multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed" or
deactivate the existing EPS bearer contexts for the PDN connection
locally without notification to the UE and proceed with the requested
PDN connectivity procedure.

b) UE initiated PDN connectivity request with request type "handover"
for a PDN connection that does not exist:

If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message for either a
default APN or a specific APN with request type set to "handover" and
the MME does not have any information about that PDN connection, then
MME shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure including the
ESM cause #54 "PDN connection does not exist", in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REJECT message.

c) ESM information not received:

If the ESM information transfer flag in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST
message has been set and the ESM information is not received before the
final expiry of timer T3489 as described in clause 6.6.1.2.6, the MME
shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure including the ESM
cause #53 "ESM information not received", in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT
message.

d) Additional UE initiated PDN connectivity request received from a UE
that is attached for emergency bearer services:

The MME shall reject the request with ESM cause #31 "request rejected,
unspecified".

e) A PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with request type "handover of
emergency bearer services" received from a UE and the MME does not have
any information about a P-GW currently providing emergency bearer
services for the UE or the MME is not configured with an address of a
P-GW in the MME emergency configuration data:

MME shall reject the PDN connectivity request procedure including the
ESM cause #54 "PDN connection does not exist", in the PDN CONNECTIVITY
REJECT message.

f) Additional UE initiated PDN connectivity request received from a UE
that is attached for access to RLOS:

The MME shall reject the request with ESM cause #31 "request rejected,
unspecified".

g) PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message received from a UE which is in a
location where the PLMN is not allowed to operate

If the MME determines that the UE is in a location where the PLMN is not
allowed to operate, the MME discards the message.

6.5.1.7 Handling PDN connectivity request for UE configured for dual priority

If a PDN connection exists that was established due to a request
including a low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
signalling low priority" and the upper layers of the UE request to
establish a PDN connection with the same APN and a low priority
indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority",
when initiating the PDN connectivity request procedure, the UE shall:

- send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same combination of
APN and PDN type as the existing PDN connection. If the UE receives a
PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message with ESM cause #55 "multiple PDN
connections for a given APN not allowed", the upper layers are informed
of this; or

- send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with the same APN after the
successful deactivation of the existing PDN connection.

NOTE: The above list of options also apply for the case when the
existing PDN connection was established due to a request including a low
priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low
priority" and the new request to establish a PDN connection with the
same APN contains a low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
NAS signalling low priority".

As an alternative the upper layers of the UE can request to establish a
PDN connection with a different APN.

6.5.2 UE requested PDN disconnect procedure

6.5.2.1 General

The purpose of the UE requested PDN disconnection procedure is for a UE
to request disconnection from one PDN. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN
connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE can initiate
this procedure to disconnect from any PDN as long as it is connected to
at least one other PDN. If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
supported by the UE and the MME, the UE can initiate this procedure to
disconnect from any PDN. With this procedure, all EPS bearer contexts
established towards this PDN, including the default EPS bearer context,
are released.

The UE is allowed to initiate the PDN disconnection procedure even if
the timer T3396 is running.

6.5.2.2 UE requested PDN disconnection procedure initiation

In order to request PDN disconnection from a PDN, the UE shall send a
PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message to the MME, start the timer T3492 and
enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in
figure 6.5.2.2.1). The PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message shall include the
EPS bearer identity of the default bearer associated with the PDN to
disconnect from as the linked EPS bearer identity in the PDN DISCONNECT
REQUEST message.

[]

Figure 6.5.2.2.1: UE requested PDN disconnection procedure

6.5.2.3 UE requested PDN disconnection procedure accepted by the network

Upon receipt of the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message, if it is accepted by
the network, the MME shall initiate the bearer context deactivation
procedure by sending the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
including the linked EPS bearer identity of the default bearer
associated with the PDN to disconnect from and the PTI. The behaviour of
the MME is described in clause 6.4.4.

Upon receipt of the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with a
PTI which matches the value used for the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message,
the UE shall stop the timer T3492 and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION INACTIVE. The behaviour of the UE is described in
clause 6.4.4. The UE should ensure that the procedure transaction
identity (PTI) assigned to this procedure is not released immediately.
The way to achieve this is implementation dependent. While the PTI value
is not released, the UE regards any received DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same PTI value as a network
retransmission (see clause 7.3.1).

On reception of DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message from the
UE, the MME releases all the resources reserved for the PDN in the
network.

6.5.2.4 UE requested PDN disconnection procedure not accepted by the network

Upon receipt of the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message, if it is not
accepted by the network, the MME shall send a PDN DISCONNECT REJECT
message to the UE. The PDN DISCONNECT REJECT message shall contain the
PTI and an ESM cause IE that typically indicates one of the following
ESM cause values:

#35: PTI already in use;

#43: invalid EPS bearer identity;

#49: last PDN disconnection not allowed;

#95 – 111: protocol errors.

If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the
MME, then ESM cause #49 "last PDN disconnection not allowed" is not
applicable.

Upon receipt of the PDN DISCONNECT REJECT message, the UE shall stop the
timer T3492, enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE and abort
the PDN disconnection procedure. Additionally, in all cases with the
exception of the UE having received ESM cause #49 "last PDN
disconnection not allowed" if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall deactivate all EPS
bearer contexts for this PDN connection locally without peer-to-peer
signalling between the UE and the MME. If the UE receives ESM cause #49
"last PDN disconnection not allowed" and the UE has any other PDN
connections established, the UE may locally deactivate, without
peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME, all EPS bearer
contexts associated with those other PDN connections.

6.5.2.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Expiry of timer T3492:

On the first expiry of the timer T3492, the UE shall resend the PDN
DISCONNECT REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3492. This
retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of timer
T3492, the UE shall abort the procedure, deactivate all EPS bearer
contexts for this PDN connection locally without peer-to-peer signalling
between the UE and the MME, release the PTI allocated for this
invocation and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. In order
to synchronize EPS bearer contexts status with the MME, on indication of
"back to E-UTRAN coverage" from the lower layers, the UE shall send a
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message that includes the EPS bearer
context status IE to the MME.

b) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and dedicated EPS
bearer context activation procedure:

When the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message during the PDN disconnect procedure, and the EPS bearer to be
activated belongs to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect, the
UE shall ignore the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message and proceed with the PDN disconnect procedure.

c) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and EPS bearer
context modification:

When the UE receives a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message during
the PDN disconnect procedure, and the EPS bearer to be modified belongs
to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect, the UE shall ignore
the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and proceed with the PDN
disconnect procedure.

d) Collision of UE requested PDN disconnect procedure and EPS bearer
context deactivation procedure:

When the UE receives a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
during the PDN disconnect procedure, and the EPS bearer indicated in the
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is a dedicated EPS bearer
belonging to the PDN connection the UE wants to disconnect, the UE shall
proceed with both procedures.

6.5.2.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) No PDN connection with the linked EPS bearer identity activated:

If the linked EPS bearer identity included in the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST
message does not belong to the default EPS bearer context of an
established PDN connection, the MME shall reply with a PDN DISCONNECT
REJECT message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity".

b) PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message received from a UE which is in a
location where the PLMN is not allowed to operate

If the MME determines that the UE is in a location where the PLMN is not
allowed to operate, the MME discards the message.

6.5.3 UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure

6.5.3.1 General

The purpose of the UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure is
for a UE to request an allocation of bearer resources for a traffic flow
aggregate. The UE requests a specific QoS demand (QCI) and optionally
sends a GBR requirement for a new traffic flow aggregate. If accepted by
the network, this procedure invokes a dedicated EPS bearer context
activation procedure (see clause 6.4.2) or an EPS bearer context
modification procedure (see clause 6.4.3).

If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established,
the UE shall not request additional bearer resources for this PDN
connection.

6.5.3.2 UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure initiation

In order to request the allocation of bearer resources for one traffic
flow aggregate, the UE shall send a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST
message to the MME, start timer T3480 and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in figure 6.5.3.2.1).

The UE shall include the EPS bearer identity of the default EPS bearer
associated with the requested bearer resource in the Linked EPS bearer
identity IE. The UE shall set the TFT operation code in the Traffic flow
aggregate IE to "Create new TFT". The packet filters in the Traffic flow
aggregate IE shall include at least one packet filter applicable for the
uplink direction. In the Required traffic flow QoS IE, the UE shall
indicate a QCI and, if the UE also includes a GBR, the additional GBR
required for the traffic flow aggregate.

[]

Figure 6.5.3.2.1: UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure

For the NBIFOM procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.161 [36], the UE may
send a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message to the MME. If the
traffic flow aggregate IE is not needed in those procedures, the UE
shall set:

- the length indicator of the Traffic flow aggregate IE to the value 1;

- the TFT operation code to "000";

- the E bit to zero; and

- the number of packet filters to zero;

and in the Required traffic flow QoS IE:

- the length indicator to the value 1; and

- the QCI to zero.

6.5.3.3 UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure accepted by the network

Upon receipt of the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message, the MME
checks whether the resources requested by the UE can be established by
verifying the EPS bearer identity given in the Linked EPS bearer
identity IE to be any of the active default EPS bearer context(s).

If the bearer resource allocation requested is accepted by the network,
the MME shall initiate either a dedicated EPS bearer context activation
procedure or an EPS bearer context modification procedure. Upon receipt
of an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message with a PTI which matches the value used for the
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer
T3480 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. The UE should
ensure that the procedure transaction identity (PTI) assigned to this
procedure is not released immediately. The way to achieve this is
implementation dependent. While the PTI value is not released, the UE
regards any received ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or
MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same PTI value as a
network retransmission (see clause 7.3.1).

If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is
received, the UE shall verify that the EPS bearer identity given in the
EPS bearer identity IE is not already used by any EPS bearer context.
The UE shall then proceed as described in clause 6.4.2.3 or clause
6.4.2.4.

If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is received, the UE
verifies that the EPS bearer identity given in the EPS bearer identity
IE is any of the active EPS bearer contexts. The UE shall then proceed
as described in clause 6.4.3.3 or clause 6.4.3.4.

6.5.3.4 UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure not accepted by the network

6.5.3.4.1 General

If the bearer resource allocation requested cannot be accepted by the
network, the MME shall send a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message
to the UE. The message shall contain the PTI and an ESM cause value
indicating the reason for rejecting the UE requested bearer resource
allocation.

The ESM cause value typically indicates one of the following:

#26: insufficient resources;

#30: request rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW;

#31: request rejected, unspecified;

#32: service option not supported;

#33: requested service option not subscribed;

#34: service option temporarily out of order;

#35: PTI already in use;

#37: EPS QoS not accepted;

#41: semantic error in the TFT operation;

#42: syntactical error in the TFT operation;

#43: invalid EPS bearer identity;

#44: semantic error(s) in packet filter(s);

#45: syntactical error(s) in packet filter(s);

#56: collision with network initiated request;

#59: unsupported QCI value;

#60: bearer handling not supported;

#65: maximum number of EPS bearers reached; or

#95 – 111: protocol errors.

If the bearer resource allocation requested is for an established LIPA
PDN connection or SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, then the
network shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message
with ESM cause #60 "bearer handling not supported".

If the requested new TFT is not available, then the BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REJECT message shall be sent.

The TFT in the request message is checked by the network for different
types of TFT IE errors as follows:

a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

1) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Create a new TFT".

The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #41
"semantic error in the TFT operation".

b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and the packet filter
list in the TFT IE is empty.

2) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the
TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters
subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #42
"syntactical error in the TFT operation".

c) Semantic errors in packet filters:

1) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components
which would render the packet filter ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will
ever fit this packet filter. How the network determines a semantic error
in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

2) When the resulting TFT does not contain any packet filter which
applicable for the uplink direction.

The network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause #44
"semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

1) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and two or more packet
filters in the resultant TFT would have identical packet filter
identifiers.

2) When the TFT operation = "Create a new TFT" and two or more packet
filters among all TFTs associated with the PDN connection would have
identical packet filter precedence values.

3) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of
packet filters, such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter
component identifier.

In case 2, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS
bearer context, the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further
process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall
delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence
values. Furthermore, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context
deactivation request procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer
context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters.

In case 2, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS
bearer context, the network shall release the relevant PDN connection
using the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure. If it is the last
remaining PDN connection and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
not supported by the UE or the MME, the network shall detach the UE
using detach type "re-attach required".

Otherwise the network shall reject the allocation request with ESM cause
#45 "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)".

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REJECT message.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the ESM cause value is
different from #26 "insufficient resources" and #65 "maximum number of
EPS bearers reached", the network may include the Re-attempt indicator
IE to indicate:

- whether the UE is allowed to attempt a secondary PDP context
activation procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode or
a PDU session modification procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in N1
mode; and

- whether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode, in S1 mode or in N1 mode
is allowed in an equivalent PLMN.

Upon receipt of a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message, the UE
shall stop the timer T3480, release the traffic flow aggregate
description associated to the PTI value, and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

6.5.3.4.2 Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause #26

If the ESM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off
timer value IE is included, the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator
IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions depending
on the timer value received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value
IE (if the UE is configured for dual priority, exceptions are specified
in clause 6.5.5; if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in
selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in clause 6.3.5):

i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if it is
running. The UE shall then start T3396 with the value provided in the
Back-off timer value IE and not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST,
BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified
in clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
same APN until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. If the UE
did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and
the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated
with no APN if it is running. The UE shall start timer T3396 with the
received value and not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from
"handover of emergency bearer services", or another BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a
non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the
UE, until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. The UE shall
not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;

ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE
shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed or the UE
receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE
DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message for the same APN from the network or a DEACTIVATE EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation
requested" for a default EPS bearer context for the same APN from the
network. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the
PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and
from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall not send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN and with request
type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with
exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection
established without APN provided by the UE, until the UE is switched off
or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or
MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN
connection established without an APN provided by the UE, or a
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39
"reactivation requested" for a default EPS bearer context of a
non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the
UE. The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or
inter-system change; or

iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

- shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if
running, and may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for
the same APN; and

- if the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN
connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from
"handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer T3396
associated with no APN, if running, and may send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN, or another BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a
non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the
UE.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, the UE may send a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN.

The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation
dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.

If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE
behaves as follows:

- let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1;

- if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running for a specific APN,
because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message containing the low
priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer
T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE configured for dual
priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in
clause 6.5.5; and

- if prior to switch off timer T3396 was running because a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST
message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured
for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for
timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE
configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as
indicated in clause 6.5.5.

6.5.3.4.3 Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause other than ESM cause #26

If the ESM cause value is different from #26 "insufficient resources"
and #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached", and the Back-off timer
value IE is included, the UE shall behave as follows depending on the
timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE (if the UE is a UE
configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions are specified
in clause 6.3.6):

- if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall start the back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off
timer value IE for the bearer resource allocation procedure and PLMN and
APN combination and not send another BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST
message in the PLMN for the same APN until the back-off timer expires,
the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed;

- if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE
shall not send another BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in the
PLMN for the same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is
removed; and

- if the timer value indicates zero, the UE may send another BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE shall ignore
the Re-attempt Indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

1) Additionally, if the ESM cause value is #32 "service option not
supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the UE
shall proceed as follows:

- if the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the
EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall behave as
described above in the present clause, using the configured
SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM
file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, as
back-off timer value; and

NOTE 0: The way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryWaitTime values
for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is
configured with:
- an SM_RetryWaitTime value in ME as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A];
and
- an SM_RetryWaitTime value in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

- otherwise, if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or a PLMN that is
within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present) or the
SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as
described above in the present clause, using the default value of 12
minutes for the back-off timer.

2) For ESM cause values different from #32 "service option not
supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the UE
behaviour regarding the start of a back-off timer is unspecified.

The UE shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or
inter-system change. If the network indicates that a back-off timer for
the bearer resource allocation procedure and PLMN and APN combination is
deactivated, then it remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or
inter-system change.

NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be
deactivated for the given ESM procedure and PLMN and APN combination
when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change
back from A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode to S1 mode. Thus the UE can still
be prevented from sending another BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST
message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REJECT (i.e. the timer value was provided by the network, a
configured value is available or the default value is used as explained
above) or the back-off timer is deactivated, the UE behaves as follows:

1) after a PLMN change the UE may send a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
REQUEST message for the same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer
is not running and is not deactivated for the bearer resource allocation
procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN.

Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #32
"service option not supported" or #33 "requested service option not
subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE,
the UE may decide not to automatically send another BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE, if
the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent
PLMNs;

2) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to
indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, or
the UE ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off
timer value IE is not included, then:

- if the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the
EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall apply the
configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, to determine whether the UE may
attempt a secondary PDP context activation procedure for the same PLMN
and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU session modification
procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in N1 mode; and

NOTE 2: The way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange
values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is
configured with:

- an SM_RetryAtRATChange value in ME as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]; and

- an SM_RetryAtRATChange value in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

- if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within
the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), or if the NAS
configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] is not available
and the value for inter-system change is not configured in the USIM file
NAS_(CONFIG), then the UE behaviour regarding a secondary PDP context
activation procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu
mode and a PDU session modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN
combination in N1 mode are unspecified; and

3) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that
re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then depending on the
timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each
combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE
shall start a back-off timer for the bearer resource allocation
procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the
respective back-off timer as follows:

- if the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt
in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, the UE shall start or
deactivate the back-off timer for S1 mode only; and

- otherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for
A/Gb, Iu, S1 and N1 mode.

If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or
deactivated in A/Gb or Iu mode upon receipt of an ACTIVATE SECONDARY PDP
CONTEXT REJECT message (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) and the network
indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off
timer does not prevent the UE from sending a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change
to S1 mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not
allowed, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST
message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1
mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is
removed.

If a back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination, in combination with
any S-NSSAI or without S-NSSAI (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) was started or
deactivated in N1 mode upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT
message (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) and the network indicated that
re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not
prevent the UE from sending a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message
in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If
the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE
shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this
PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the
timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed. If more
than one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was
started in N1 mode with an indication from the network that re-attempt
in S1 mode is not allowed and no back-off timer for the same PLMN and
APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN
after inter-system change to S1 mode until all timers have expired. If
at least one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN combination was
deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN until the UE is
switched off or the USIM is removed.

NOTE 3: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the
required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific
implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

NOTE 4: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to
use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer
within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to
UE implementation. This back-off timer is stopped when the UE is
switched off or the USIM is removed.

If the ESM cause value is #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers reached",
the UE shall determine the PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts
in S1 mode (see clause 6.5.0) as the number of active EPS bearer
contexts it has. The UE shall ignore the Back-off timer value IE and
Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

NOTE 5: In some situations, when attempting to establish multiple EPS
bearer contexts, the number of active EPS bearer contexts in the UE when
cause #65 is received is not equal to the maximum number of EPS bearer
contexts reached in the network.

The PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode applies to
the PLMN in which the ESM cause #65 "maximum number of EPS bearers
reached" is received. When the UE is switched off or when the USIM is
removed, the UE shall clear all previous determinations representing any
PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1 mode. Upon successful
registration with a new PLMN, the UE may clear previous determinations
representing any PLMN's maximum number of EPS bearer contexts in S1
mode.

The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation
dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.

6.5.3.4A Handling the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts

If the UE requests allocation of additional bearer resources, and the
network has reached its maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts,
then the network can:

- reject the request if the network decides that it is necessary to
allocate a dedicated EPS bearer context; or

- accept the request by sending a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message.

NOTE: An example of where the network will reject the request for
allocation of additional bearer resources is when the request includes a
GBR requirement while all existing bearers are non-GBR bearers, and the
maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts has been reached at the
network.

If the maximum number of active EPS bearer contexts is reached at the UE
(see clause 6.5.0) and the UE de-activates an active EPS bearer context
prior to sending the request for additional bearer resources, then
choosing which EPS bearer context to de-activate is a implementation
specific, however the UE shall not deactivate a default EPS bearer
context for emergency.

6.5.3.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Expiry of timer T3480:

On the first expiry of the timer T3480, the UE shall resend the BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3480.
This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of
timer T3480, the UE shall abort the procedure, release the PTI allocated
for this activation and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

b) Unknown EPS bearer context

Upon receipt of the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message including
ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity", the UE shall deactivate the
existing default EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-peer
signalling between the UE and the MME and shall stop the timer T3480.

c) Collision of a UE requested bearer resource allocation procedure and
an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

When the UE receives a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for
the default EPS bearer context related to the UE requested bearer
resource allocation procedure, the UE shall abort the UE requested
bearer resource allocation procedure and shall stop the timer T3480 and
proceed with the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

6.5.3.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) No PDN connection with the linked EPS bearer identity activated:

If the linked EPS bearer identity included in the BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message does not belong to the default EPS bearer
context of an established PDN connection, the MME shall reply with a
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message with ESM cause #43 "invalid
EPS bearer identity".

b) BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message received for a PDN
connection established for emergency bearer services:

The MME shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message
with ESM cause #31 "request rejected, unspecified".

c) BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message received from a UE which
is in a location where the PLMN is not allowed to operate

If the MME determines that the UE is in a location where the PLMN is not
allowed to operate, the MME discards the message.

6.5.4 UE requested bearer resource modification procedure

6.5.4.1 General

The purpose of the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure
is for a UE to:

a) request a modification;

b) release of bearer resources for a traffic flow aggregate;

c) modify a traffic flow aggregate by replacing packet filters or adding
packet filters;

d) re-negotiate header compression configuration associated to an EPS
bearer context;

e) indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status for a PDN connection;

f) transmit information for the C2 authorization for the UAS services;
or

g) provide a UE policy container with the length of two octets
containing the UE STATE INDICATION message (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
annex D).

When requesting a modification of bearer resources for a traffic flow
aggregate or a modification of a traffic flow aggregate, the UE can
modify the existing GBR. If accepted by the network, this procedure
invokes a dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure (see
clause 6.4.2), an EPS bearer context modification procedure (see
clause 6.4.3), or an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure (see
clause 6.4.4).

If there is a PDN connection for emergency bearer services established,
the UE shall not request a modification of bearer resources for this PDN
connection.

When the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure is used to
indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status for a PDN connection
(see clause 6.3.10), the UE shall initiate the UE requested bearer
resource modification procedure even if the timer T3396 or the back-off
timer is running or is deactivated.

6.5.4.2 UE requested bearer resource modification procedure initiation

In order to request the modification of bearer resources for one traffic
flow aggregate, the UE shall send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
message to the MME, start timer T3481 and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in figure 6.5.4.2.1).

The UE shall include the EPS bearer identity of the EPS bearer
associated with the traffic flow aggregate in the EPS bearer identity
for packet filter IE.

To request a change of the GBR without changing the packet filter(s),
the UE shall set the TFT operation code in the Traffic flow aggregate IE
to "no TFT operation" and include the packet filter identifier(s) to
which the change of the GBR applies in the Packet filter identifier
parameter in the parameters list. The UE shall indicate the new GBR
requested for the EPS bearer context in the Required traffic flow QoS
IE.

To request a modification of a traffic flow aggregate, the UE shall set
the TFT operation code in the Traffic flow aggregate IE to "Replace
packet filters in existing TFT" or "Add packet filters to existing TFT".
If the TFT operation code is set to "Add packet filters to existing
TFT", the UE shall include in the parameter list one existing packet
filter identifier to which the newly added packet filter(s) is linked.
If the EPS bearer is a GBR bearer and the UE also wishes to request a
change of GBR, the UE shall indicate the new GBR requested for the EPS
bearer context in the Required traffic flow QoS IE.

To request a release of bearer resources, the UE shall set the TFT
operation code in the Traffic flow aggregate IE to "Delete packet
filters from existing TFT". If the EPS bearer is a GBR bearer and the UE
does not request the release of all bearer resources, the UE shall
indicate the new GBR requested for the EPS bearer context in the
Required traffic flow QoS IE.

To request re-negotiation of header compression configuration associated
to an EPS bearer context, the UE shall include the Header compression
configuration IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message if
the network indicated "Control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported"
and "Header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization
supported" in the EPS network feature support IE.

After an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, if:

a) the UE is operating in single-registration mode and has received the
interworking without N26 interface indicator set to "interworking
without N26 interface not supported" from the network;

b) the PDN type value of the PDN type IE is set to "IPv4", "IPv6" or
"IPv4v6";

c) the UE indicates "Control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported" and
"Header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported"
in the UE network capability IE of the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message; and

d) the network indicates "Control plane CIoT EPS optimization supported"
and "Header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization
supported" in the EPS network feature support IE of the TRACKING AREA
UPDATE ACCEPT message;

the UE shall send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the
MME and include the Header compression configuration IE to negotiate the
header compression configuration.

To indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status associated to a PDN
connection, the UE shall include the Protocol configuration options IE
in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message and set the 3GPP PS
data off UE status only if:

- the network included the 3GPP PS data off support indication in the
Protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message when the PDN connection was established; or

- the PDU session was established when in N1 mode.

To indicate a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status, the UE shall include
the EPS bearer identity of the default EPS bearer context of the PDN
connection, for which the UE wishes a change of the 3GPP PS data off UE
status, in the EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE.

The UE behaves as described in clause 6.3.10.

If the UE requests the modification of a traffic flow aggregate, which
is assigned to a dedicated EPS bearer context, it shall ensure that at
least one packet filter applicable for the uplink direction remains
among the packet filters created on request from the UE in that TFT, or
no own packet filters.

NOTE 1: If the UE requests the release of all bearer resources of a GBR
bearer and includes a Required traffic flow QoS IE in the BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the network ignores the Required
traffic flow QoS IE.

If the UE includes the Required traffic flow QoS IE, the UE shall set
the QCI to the current QCI value of the EPS bearer context.

If the UE requests the release of bearer resources, the ESM cause value
typically indicates one of the following:

#36: regular deactivation.

To perform authorization for the C2 communication when a PDN connection
is already established for the USS communication, the UE shall include
the Extended protocol configuration options IE in the BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST message containing the service-level-AA container
with the length of two octets. In the service-level-AA container with
the length of two octets, the UE shall include:

a) the service-level device ID, with the value set to CAA-level UAV ID;

b) if provided by the upper layers, the service-level-AA payload type
parameter with the value set to "C2 authorization payload"; and

c) the service-level-AA payload parameter, with the value set to C2
authorization payload.

NOTE 2: The C2 authorization payload can contain one, some or all of the
pairing information for C2 communication, an indication of the request
for direct C2 communication, pairing information for direct C2
communication and flight authorization information.

To provide a UE policy container with the length of two octets
containing the UE STATE INDICATION message (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]
annex D), the UE shall include the Extended protocol configuration
options IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message, and
include the UE policy container with the length of two octets in the
Extended protocol configuration options IE.

[]

Figure 6.5.4.2.1: UE requested bearer resource modification procedure

For the NBIFOM procedures as defined in 3GPP TS 24.161 [36], the UE may
send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the MME.

It is possible that the traffic flow aggregate IE is not needed in the
following procedures:

- re-negotiation of header compression configuration associated to an
EPS bearer context;

- indicating a change of 3GPP PS data off UE status associated to a PDN
connection; or

- NBIFOM procedures.

If the traffic flow aggregate IE is not needed, the UE shall set:

- the length indicator of the Traffic flow aggregate IE to the value 1;

- the TFT operation code to "000";

- the E bit to zero; and

- the number of packet filters to zero.

6.5.4.3 UE requested bearer resource modification procedure accepted by the network

Upon receipt of the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the
MME checks whether the resources requested by the UE can be established,
modified or released by verifying the EPS bearer identity given in the
EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE.

If the bearer resource modification requested is accepted by the
network, the MME shall initiate either a dedicated EPS bearer context
activation procedure, an EPS bearer context modification procedure or an
EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

If the request to re-negotiate header compression configuration
associated to an EPS bearer context is accepted by the network, the MME
shall initiate an EPS bearer context modification procedure.

If the bearer resource modification requests a release of bearer
resources that results in the TFT of the EPS bearer context containing
only packet filters applicable to the uplink direction, the network may
initiate the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

Upon receipt of an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, MODIFY
EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message with a PTI which matches the value used for the BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the UE shall stop timer T3481 and enter
the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. The UE should ensure that the
procedure transaction identity (PTI) assigned to this procedure is not
released immediately. The way to achieve this is implementation
dependent. While the PTI value is not released, the UE regards any
received ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
with the same PTI value as a network retransmission (see clause 7.3.1).

i) If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is
received, the UE shall verify that the EPS bearer identity given in the
EPS bearer identity IE is not already used by any EPS bearer context.
The UE shall then proceed as described in clause 6.4.2.3 or
clause 6.4.2.4.

ii) If the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is received, the UE
verifies that the EPS bearer identity given in the EPS bearer identity
IE is any of the active EPS bearer contexts. The UE shall then proceed
as described in clause 6.4.3.3 or clause 6.4.3.4.

iii) If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is received,
the UE verifies that the EPS bearer identity given in the EPS bearer
identity IE is one of the active EPS bearer contexts. The UE shall then
proceed as described in clause 6.4.4.3.

In case i, after successful completion of the dedicated EPS bearer
context activation procedure, the network may initiate an EPS bearer
context modification procedure to delete the packet filters which have
packet filter identifiers indicated by the UE in the Traffic flow
aggregate IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message and for
which the network created new packet filters during the dedicated EPS
bearer context activation procedure. In this case the MME shall set the
procedure transaction identity value in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message to "no procedure transaction identity assigned".

6.5.4.4 UE requested bearer resource modification procedure not accepted by the network

6.5.4.4.1 General

If the bearer resource modification requested cannot be accepted by the
network, the MME shall send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT
message to the UE. The message shall contain the PTI and an ESM cause
value indicating the reason for rejecting the UE requested bearer
resource modification.

The ESM cause value typically indicates one of the following:

#26: insufficient resources;

#30: request rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW;

#31: request rejected, unspecified;

#32: service option not supported;

#33: requested service option not subscribed;

#34: service option temporarily out of order;

#35: PTI already in use;

#37: EPS QoS not accepted;

#41: semantic error in the TFT operation;

#42: syntactical error in the TFT operation;

#43: invalid EPS bearer identity;

#44: semantic error(s) in packet filter(s);

#45: syntactical error(s) in packet filter(s);

#56: collision with network initiated request;

#59: unsupported QCI value;

#60: bearer handling not supported; or

#95 – 111: protocol errors.

If the bearer resource modification requested is for an established LIPA
PDN connection or SIPTO at the local network PDN connection, then the
network shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message
with ESM cause #60 "bearer handling not supported".

If the requested new TFT is not available, then the BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REJECT message shall be sent.

The TFT in the request message is checked by the network for different
types of TFT IE errors as follows:

a) Semantic errors in TFT operations:

1) When the TFT operation is an operation other than "Replace packet
filters in existing TFT", "Add packet filters to existing TFT", "Delete
packet filters from existing TFT" or "No TFT operation".

2) When the TFT operation is "Replace packet filters in existing TFT",
"Add packet filters to existing TFT" or "Delete packet filters from
existing TFT", the EPS bearer context being modified is the default EPS
bearer content and there is no TFT for the default EPS bearer context.

3) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" when it
would render the TFT empty.

In case 1 the network shall reject the modification request with ESM
cause #41 "semantic error in the TFT operation".

In case 2, if the TFT operation is "Delete packet filters from existing
TFT", the network shall further process the new request and, if no error
according to items b, c, and d was detected, shall perform an EPS bearer
context modification procedure including the value of EPS bearer
identity for packet filter IE in the EPS bearer identity IE and a TFT IE
with TFT operation = "Delete existing TFT" in the MODIFY EPS BEARER
CONTEXT REQUEST message.

In case 2, if the TFT operation is "Replace packet filters in existing
TFT" or "Add packet filters to existing TFT", the network shall process
the new request as a request with TFT operation = "Create a new TFT".

In case 3, if the packet filters belong to a dedicated EPS bearer
context, the network shall process the new deletion request and, if no
error according to items b, c, and d was detected, delete the existing
TFT. After successful deletion of the TFT, the network shall perform an
EPS bearer context deactivation request procedure to deactivate the
dedicated EPS bearer context between the UE and the network.

In case 3, if the packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer
context, the network shall process the new deletion request and if no
error according to items b, c, and d was detected then perform an EPS
bearer context modification procedure to remove the existing TFT of the
default EPS bearer context, this corresponds to using match-all packet
filter for the default EPS bearer context.

b) Syntactical errors in TFT operations:

1) When the TFT operation = "Replace packet filters in existing TFT",
"Add packet filters to existing TFT" or "Delete packet filters from
existing TFT", and the packet filter list in the TFT IE is empty.

2) TFT operation = "No TFT operation" with a non-empty packet filter
list in the TFT IE.

3) TFT operation = "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" when the
packet filter to be replaced does not exist in the original TFT.

4) TFT operation = "Delete packet filters from existing TFT" when the
packet filter to be deleted does not exist in the original TFT.

5) Void

6) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of the
TFT IE, such as a mismatch between the number of packet filters
subfield, and the number of packet filters in the packet filter list.

7) TFT operation = "No TFT operation" with an empty parameters list.

In case 3 the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process
the replace request and, if no error according to items c and d was
detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure
using TFT operation = "Add packet filters to existing TFT" to include
the packet filters received to the existing TFT.

In case 4 the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further process
the deletion request and, if no error according to items c and d was
detected, shall perform an EPS bearer context modification procedure
including the value of EPS bearer identity for packet filter IE in the
EPS bearer identity IE and a TFT IE with TFT operation = "Delete packet
filters from existing TFT" and the received packet filter identifier(s)
in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.

Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with ESM
cause #42 "syntactical error in the TFT operation".

NOTE: An implementation that strictly follows packet filter list as
defined in subclause 10.5.6.12 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13] might not detect
case 2).

c) Semantic errors in packet filters:

1) When a packet filter consists of conflicting packet filter components
which would render the packet filter ineffective, i.e. no IP packet will
ever fit this packet filter. How the network determines a semantic error
in a packet filter is outside the scope of the present document.

2) When the resulting TFT, which is assigned to a dedicated EPS bearer
context, does not contain any packet filter applicable for the uplink
direction.

The network shall reject the modification request with ESM cause #44
"semantic errors in packet filter(s)".

d) Syntactical errors in packet filters:

1) When the TFT operation = "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" or
"Add packet filters to existing TFT", and two or more packet filters in
the resultant TFT would have identical packet filter identifiers.

2) When the TFT operation = "Replace packet filters in existing TFT" or
"Add packet filters to existing TFT", and two or more packet filters in
all TFTs associated with the PDN connection would have identical packet
filter precedence values.

3) When there are other types of syntactical errors in the coding of
packet filters, such as the use of a reserved value for a packet filter
component identifier.

In case 2, if the old packet filters do not belong to the default EPS
bearer context, the network shall not diagnose an error, shall further
process the new request and, if it was processed successfully, shall
delete the old packet filters which have identical filter precedence
values. Furthermore, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context
deactivation procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context(s)
for which it has deleted the packet filters.

In case 2, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS
bearer context, the network shall release the relevant PDN connection
using the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure. If the relevant PDN
connection is the last one and EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is
not supported by the UE or the MME, the network shall detach the UE
using detach type "re-attach required".

Otherwise the network shall reject the modification request with ESM
cause #45 "syntactical errors in packet filter(s)".

The network may include a Back-off timer value IE in the BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REJECT message.

The network shall not include the ESM cause value #26 "insufficient
resources" in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message due to APN
based congestion control being active.

If the Back-off timer value IE is included and the ESM cause value is
not #26 "insufficient resources", the network may include the Re-attempt
indicator IE to indicate:

- whether the UE is allowed to attempt a PDP context modification
procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU
session modification procedure in the PLMN for the same APN in N1 mode;
and

- whether another attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode, in S1 mode or in N1 mode
is allowed in an equivalent PLMN.

Upon receipt of a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message, the UE
shall stop the timer T3481, release the traffic flow aggregate
description associated to the PTI value, and enter the state PROCEDURE
TRANSACTION INACTIVE. If the ESM cause included in the BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REJECT message is #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity", the UE
locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) without peer-to-peer ESM
signalling.

6.5.4.4.2 Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause #26

If the ESM cause value is #26 "insufficient resources" and the Back-off
timer value IE is included, the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator
IE provided by the network, if any, and take different actions depending
on the timer value received for timer T3396 in the Back-off timer value
IE (if the UE is configured for dual priority, exceptions are specified
in clause 6.5.5; if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in
selected PLMN, exceptions are specified in clause 6.3.5):

i) if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if it is
running. The UE shall then start T3396 with the value provided in the
Back-off timer value IE and not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST,
BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified
in clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
same APN until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. If the UE
did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and
the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated
with no APN if it is running. The UE shall start timer T3396 with the
received value and not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message
without an APN and with request type different from "emergency" and from
"handover of emergency bearer services", or another BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a
non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the
UE, until timer T3396 expires or timer T3396 is stopped. The UE shall
not stop timer T3396 upon a PLMN change or inter-system change;

ii) if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE
shall not send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST with exception of those identified in
clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for the
same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed or the UE
receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE
DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT
REQUEST message for the same APN from the network or a DEACTIVATE EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39 "reactivation
requested" for a default EPS bearer context for the same APN from the
network. If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the
PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and
from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall not send
another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN and with request
type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer
services", or another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST with
exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, or BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN connection
established without APN provided by the UE, until the UE is switched off
or the USIM is removed, or the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or
MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message for a non-emergency PDN
connection established without an APN provided by the UE, or a
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message including ESM cause #39
"reactivation requested" for a default EPS bearer context of a
non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the
UE. The timer T3396 remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or
inter-system change; or

iii) if the timer value indicates zero, the UE:

- shall stop timer T3396 associated with the corresponding APN, if
running, and may send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for
the same APN; and

- if the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN
connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from
"handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop timer T3396
associated with no APN, if running, and may send another PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without an APN, or another BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message for a
non-emergency PDN connection established without an APN provided by the
UE.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, the UE may send a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST messages for the same APN.

The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation
dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.

If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED,
the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same,
then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.

If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the
USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE
behaves as follows:

- let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t
be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on. If t1 is greater
than t, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. If t1
is equal to or less than t, then the timer need not be restarted. If the
UE is not capable of determining t, then the UE shall restart the timer
with the value t1;

- if prior to switch off, timer T3396 was running for a specific APN,
because a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message containing the low
priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396, and if timer
T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE configured for dual
priority shall handle session management requests as indicated in
clause 6.5.5; and

- if prior to switch off timer T3396 was running because a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN sent together with an ATTACH REQUEST
message containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured
for NAS signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for
timer T3396, and if timer T3396 is restarted at switch on, then the UE
configured for dual priority shall handle session management requests as
indicated in clause 6.5.5.

6.5.4.4.3 Handling of network rejection due to ESM cause other than ESM cause #26

If the ESM cause value is not #26 "insufficient resources", and the
Back-off timer value IE is included, the UE shall behave as follows
depending on the timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE (if
the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, exceptions
are specified in clause 6.3.6):

- if the timer value indicates neither zero nor deactivated, the UE
shall start the back-off timer with the value provided in the Back-off
timer value IE for the bearer resource modification procedure and PLMN
and APN combination and not send another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST message with exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, in
the PLMN for the same APN until the back-off timer expires, the UE is
switched off or the USIM is removed;

- if the timer value indicates that this timer is deactivated, the UE
shall not send another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message with
exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, in the PLMN for the
same APN until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed; and

- if the timer value indicates zero, the UE may send another BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same APN.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE shall ignore
the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.

1) Additionally, if the ESM cause value is #32 "service option not
supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the UE
shall proceed as follows:

- if the UE is registered in the HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the
EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall behave as
described above in the present clause, using the configured
SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM
file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, as
back-off timer value; and

NOTE 0: The way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryWaitTime values
for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is
configured with:
- an SM_RetryWaitTime value in ME as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A];
and
- an SM_RetryWaitTime value in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

- otherwise, if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or a PLMN that is
within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present) or the
SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as
described above in the present clause, using the default value of 12
minutes for the back-off timer.

2) For ESM cause values different from #32 "service option not
supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the UE
behaviour regarding the start of a back-off timer is unspecified.

The UE shall not stop any back-off timer upon a PLMN change or
inter-system change. If the network indicates that a back-off timer for
the bearer resource modification procedure and PLMN and APN combination
is deactivated, then it remains deactivated upon a PLMN change or
inter-system change.

NOTE 1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be
deactivated for the given ESM procedure and PLMN and APN combination
when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change
back from A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode to S1 mode. Thus the UE can still
be prevented from sending another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
message with exception of those identified in clause 6.5.4.1, in the
PLMN for the same APN.

If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REJECT (i.e. the timer value was provided by the network, a
configured value is available or the default value is used as explained
above) or the back-off timer is deactivated, the UE behaves as follows:

1) after a PLMN change the UE may send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION
REQUEST message for the same APN in the new PLMN, if the back-off timer
is not running and is not deactivated for the bearer resource
modification procedure and the combination of new PLMN and APN.

Furthermore as an implementation option, for the ESM cause values #32
"service option not supported" or #33 "requested service option not
subscribed", if the network does not include a Re-attempt indicator IE,
the UE may decide not to automatically send another BEARER RESOURCE
MODIFICATION REQUEST message for the same APN that was sent by the UE,
if the UE is registered to a new PLMN which is in the list of equivalent
PLMNs;

2) if the network does not include the Re-attempt indicator IE to
indicate whether re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, or
the UE ignores the Re-attempt indicator IE, e.g. because the Back-off
timer value IE is not included, then:

- if the UE is registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within the
EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall apply the
configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17], if available, to determine whether the UE may
attempt a PDP context modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN
combination in A/Gb or Iu mode or a PDU session modification procedure
for the same PLMN and APN combination in N1 mode; and

NOTE 2: The way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange
values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is
configured with:

- an SM_RetryAtRATChange value in ME as specified in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A]; and

- an SM_RetryAtRATChange value in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

- if the UE is not registered in its HPLMN or in a PLMN that is within
the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), or if the NAS
configuration MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] is not available
and the value for inter-system change is not configured in the USIM file
NAS_(CONFIG), then the UE behaviour regarding a PDP context modification
procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination in A/Gb or Iu mode and a
PDU session modification procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination
in N1 mode are unspecified; and

3) if the network includes the Re-attempt indicator IE indicating that
re-attempt in an equivalent PLMN is not allowed, then depending on the
timer value received in the Back-off timer value IE, for each
combination of a PLMN from the equivalent PLMN list and the APN the UE
shall start a back-off timer for the bearer resource modification
procedure with the value provided by the network, or deactivate the
respective back-off timer as follows:

- if the Re-attempt indicator IE additionally indicates that re-attempt
in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, the UE shall start or
deactivate the back-off timer for S1 mode only; and

- otherwise the UE shall start or deactivate the back-off timer for
A/Gb, Iu, S1 and N1 mode.

If the back-off timer for a PLMN and APN combination was started or
deactivated upon receipt of an MODIFY PDP CONTEXT REJECT message (see
3GPP TS 24.008 [13]) and the network indicated that re-attempt in S1
mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not prevent the UE from
sending a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for
the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode. If the network
indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall not
send any BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for
the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until the timer
expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

If a back-off timers for a PLMN and APN combination, in combination with
any S-NSSAI or without S-NSSAI (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) was started or
deactivated in N1 mode upon receipt of a PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT
message (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [54]) and the network indicated that
re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed, then this back-off timer does not
prevent the UE from sending a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1
mode. If the network indicated that re-attempt in S1 mode is not
allowed, the UE shall not send any BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST
message in this PLMN for the same APN after inter-system change to S1
mode until the timer expires, the UE is switched off or the USIM is
removed. If more than one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN
combination was started in N1 mode with an indication from the network
that re-attempt in S1 mode is not allowed and no back-off timer for the
same PLMN and APN combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall
not send any BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN
for the same APN after inter-system change to S1 mode until all timers
have expired. If at least one back-off timer for the same PLMN and APN
combination was deactivated in N1 mode, the UE shall not send any BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message in this PLMN for the same APN
until the UE is switched off or the USIM is removed.

NOTE 3: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the
required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific
implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

NOTE 4: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to
use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer
within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to
UE implementation. This back-off timer is stopped when the UE is
switched off or the USIM is removed.

The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation
dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.

6.5.4.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Expiry of timer T3481:

On the first expiry of the timer T3481, the UE shall resend the BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T3481.
This retransmission is repeated four times, i.e. on the fifth expiry of
timer T3481, the UE shall abort the procedure, release the PTI allocated
for this activation and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.
In addition, if the UE had initiated resource release for all the
traffic flows for the bearer, it shall deactivate the EPS bearer context
locally without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME. In
order to synchronize the EPS bearer context status with the MME, on
indication of "back to E-UTRAN coverage" from the lower layers, the UE
shall send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message that includes the EPS
bearer context status IE to the MME.

b) Unknown EPS bearer context:

Upon receipt of the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message
including ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity", the UE shall
deactivate the existing EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-peer
signalling between the UE and the MME and shall stop the timer T3481.

c) Collision of a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure
and an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure:

When the UE receives a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
during the bearer resource modification procedure, and the EPS bearer
identity indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message
is an EPS bearer context the UE indicated in the UE requested bearer
resource modification procedure, then the UE shall abort the UE
requested bearer resource modification procedure and shall stop the
timer T3481 and proceed with the EPS bearer context deactivation
procedure.

d) Rejection of a UE requested bearer resource modification procedure
when the UE has initiated the procedure to release all traffic flows for
the bearer:

Upon receipt of a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message with ESM
cause value #31 "request rejected, unspecified", if the UE had initiated
resource release for all the traffic flows for the bearer, it shall
deactivate the EPS bearer context locally without peer-to-peer
signalling between the UE and the MME and shall stop the timer T3481. In
order to synchronize the EPS bearer context status with the MME, the UE
may send a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message that includes the EPS
bearer context status IE to the MME.

e) Collision of UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and
EPS bearer context modification procedure:

The handling of the same abnormal case as described in clause 6.4.3.5
applies.

6.5.4.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Unknown EPS bearer context:

If the EPS bearer identity provided in the EPS bearer identity for
packet filter IE in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message
indicates an EPS bearer identity value and this does not belong to any
already activated EPS bearer context, the MME shall reply with a BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS
bearer identity".

b) BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message received for a PDN
connection established for emergency bearer services:

The MME shall reply with a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message
with ESM cause #30 "request rejected by Serving GW or PDN GW".

c) Collision of UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and
EPS bearer context modification procedure:

The handling of the same abnormal case as described in clause 6.4.3.6
applies.

d) BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message received from a UE which
is in a location where the PLMN is not allowed to operate:

If the MME determines that the UE is in a location where the PLMN is not
allowed to operate, the MME discards the message.

6.5.5 Handling session management request for UE configured for dual priority

If timer T3396 is running for a specific APN due to one of the following
reasons:

- a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or
BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message containing the low priority
indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority" was
rejected with a timer value for timer T3396 and ESM cause value #26
"insufficient resources";

- a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received with a
timer value for timer T3396 and ESM cause value #26 "insufficient
resources" for a PDN connection established with low priority indicator
set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", or

- because the UE received a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message containing a timer value for timer T3396 and ESM cause value #26
"insufficient resources" for a PDN connection established with low
priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low
priority",

upon request of the upper layers the UE can:

- send a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to the same APN, with low
priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low
priority"; or,

- send a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE
ALLOCATION REQUEST message, with low priority indicator set to "MS is
not configured for NAS signalling low priority", for a PDN connection
established with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for
NAS signalling low priority" exists.

If timer T3396 is running, because any of the following messages
containing the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS
signalling low priority" was rejected with a timer value for timer T3396
and ESM cause value #26 "insufficient resources":

- a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST without APN and with request type different
from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", sent
together with an ATTACH REQUEST message;

- a stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message without APN and with
request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency
bearer services"; or

- a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION
REQUEST message sent for a non-emergency PDN connection established
without APN provided by the UE,

or because the UE received a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message containing a timer value for timer T3396 and ESM cause value #26
"insufficient resources" for a non-emergency PDN connection established
without APN provided by the UE and established with low priority
indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority",
then upon request of the upper layers the UE can initiate a new attach
procedure or stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST procedure without APN
and with request type different from "emergency" and from "handover of
emergency bearer services", with low priority indicator set to "MS is
not configured for NAS signalling low priority".

For requests with low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for
NAS signalling low priority", the UE shall follow the procedures
specified in clause 6.5.1.4.

6.6 Miscellaneous procedures

6.6.1 Exchange of protocol configuration options

6.6.1.1 General

The UE and the PDN GW can exchange protocol configuration options via
the dedicated ESM information request procedure or via other ESM
procedures.

If supported by the network and UE end-to-end for a PDN connection,
protocol configuration options shall be exchanged via the Extended
protocol configuration options IE. Otherwise the Protocol configuration
options IE is used.

NOTE 1: In this version of the protocol inter-system mobility to and
from NB-S1 mode is supported. During inter-system-mobility from NB-S1
mode to WB-S1 mode the end-to-end support of the Extended protocol
configuration options IE can be lost, e.g. if the new MME does not
support the Extended protocol configuration options IE.

For the UE, the extended protocol configuration options is supported by
the network and the UE end-to-end for a PDN connection if

- the UE is in NB-S1 mode;

- the APN requested for the PDN connection is for UAS services;

- the PDN Type requested for the PDN connection is non-IP or Ethernet;

- the network has indicated support of the Extended protocol
configuration options IE in the last ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA
UPDATING ACCEPT message and the network has included the Extended
protocol configuration options IE in at least one EPS session management
message received by the UE for this PDN connection; or

- a corresponding PDU session was transferred after inter-system change
from N1 mode to S1 mode.

For the MME, the extended protocol configuration options is supported by
the network and the UE end-to-end for a PDN connection if

- the UE is in NB-S1 mode;

- the APN requested for the PDN connection is for UAS services;

- the PDN Type requested for the PDN connection is non-IP or Ethernet;

- the UE has indicated support of the Extended protocol configuration
options IE in the last ATTACH REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATING REQUEST
message, and the MME has received the Extended protocol configuration
options IE in at least one message sent by the PDN GW towards the UE for
this PDN connection (for details see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]); or

- a corresponding PDU session was transferred after inter-system change
from N1 mode to S1 mode.

NOTE 2: For the PDN GW, the extended protocol configuration options is
supported by the network and the UE end-to-end for a PDN connection if
the last support indication received from the MME or S-GW indicates that
extended protocol configuration options is supported for this PDN
connection (for details see 3GPP TS 29.274 [16D]).

6.6.1.2 ESM information request procedure

6.6.1.2.1 General

The ESM information request procedure is used by the network to retrieve
ESM information, i.e. protocol configuration options, APN, or both from
the UE during the attach procedure if the UE indicated in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message that it has ESM information that needs to
be sent security protected. The purpose of this procedure is to provide
privacy for the ESM information if ciphering is enabled in the network.

6.6.1.2.2 ESM information request initiated by the network

The network initiates the ESM information request procedure by sending
an ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message to the UE, starting timer T3489 and
entering the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in
figure 6.6.1.2.2.1). This message shall be sent only after the security
context has been setup, and if the ESM information transfer flag has
been set in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message. The MME shall set the
EPS bearer identity of the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message to the value
"no EPS bearer identity assigned" and include the PTI from the
associated PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

[]

Figure 6.6.1.2.2.1: ESM information request procedure

6.6.1.2.3 ESM information request completion by the UE

Upon receipt of the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message, the UE shall send
an ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message to the network. The UE shall include
all the protocol configuration options that need to be transferred
security protected, and APN if required, to the network in the ESM
INFORMATION RESPONSE message. The UE shall set the EPS bearer identity
of the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message to the value "no EPS bearer
identity assigned" and include the PTI from the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST
message.

6.6.1.2.4 ESM information request completion by the network

Upon receipt of the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message, the network shall
stop timer T3489 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE. A
Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration
options IE included in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message replaces any
Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration
options IE that the network previously may have received during the
attach procedure execution.

6.6.1.2.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

Apart from the case described in clause 6.3.3, no abnormal cases have
been identified.

6.6.1.2.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Expiry of timer T3489:

On the first expiry of the timer T3489, the MME shall resend the ESM
INFORMATION REQUEST message and shall reset and restart timer T3489.
This retransmission is repeated two times, i.e. on the third expiry of
timer T3489, the MME shall abort the procedure, release any resources
for this procedure and reject the associated PDN connectivity procedure
including the ESM cause #53 "ESM information not received", in the PDN
CONNECTIVITY REJECT message.

6.6.1.3 Exchange of protocol configuration options in other messages

The UE may include a Protocol configuration options IE or Extended
protocol configuration options IE on EPS bearer context activation, EPS
bearer context deactivation, EPS bearer context modification, PDN
connectivity request, PDN disconnect request, bearer resource allocation
request and bearer resource modification request if the UE wishes to
transmit (protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or
messages/events) to the PDN GW or the SCEF. In particular, the UE may
use this procedure on EPS bearer context activation to perform the
MSISDN notification procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13],
clause 6.4.

The PDN GW or the SCEF may include a Protocol configuration options IE
or Extended protocol configuration options IE on EPS bearer context
activation, EPS bearer context deactivation, EPS bearer context
modification, PDN connectivity reject, PDN disconnect reject, bearer
resource allocation reject and bearer resource modification reject if
the PDN GW or the SCEF wishes to transmit (protocol) data (e.g.
configuration parameters, error codes or messages/events) to the UE. In
particular, the PDN GW may use this procedure on EPS bearer context
activation to perform the MSISDN notification procedure as specified in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13], clause 6.4.

6.6.2 Notification procedure

6.6.2.1 General

The network can use the notification procedure to inform the UE about
events which are relevant for the upper layer which is using an EPS
bearer context or has requested a procedure transaction.

If the UE has indicated that it supports the notification procedure, the
network may initiate the procedure at any time while a PDN connection
exists or a procedure transaction is ongoing.

6.6.2.2 Notification procedure initiation by the network

The network initiates the notification procedure by sending a
NOTIFICATION message to the UE (see example in figure 6.6.2.2.1).

[]

Figure 6.6.2.2.1: Notification procedure

6.6.2.3 Notification procedure in the UE

When the UE receives a NOTIFICATION message, the ESM protocol entity in
the UE shall provide the notification indicator to the upper layer.

The notification indicator can have the following value:

#1: SRVCC handover cancelled, IMS session re-establishment required.

6.6.2.4 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover

If the NOTIFICATION message could not be delivered due to an intra MME
handover, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the
MME shall retransmit the NOTIFICATION message. If a failure of the
handover procedure is reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling
connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the NOTIFICATION message.

6.6.3 Remote UE Report procedure

6.6.3.1 General

The purpose of the Remote UE Report procedure is for a UE acting as
ProSe UE-to-network relay to notify the network that a remote UE is
connected to the ProSe UE-to-network relay or disconnected from the
ProSe UE-to-network relay as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [31].

The UE does not initiate the remote UE report procedure if the timer
T3396 is running.

6.6.3.2 Remote UE Report initiated by the UE

The UE initiates the Remote UE Report procedure by sending a REMOTE UE
REPORT message to the network, starting timer T3493 and entering the
state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in figure 6.6.3.2.1).
The UE shall include information of newly connected or disconnected
remote UEs to the network in the REMOTE UE REPORT message. If any
encrypted IMSI remote UE identity is included in the REMOTE UE REPORT
message, the UE shall include the corresponding ProSe Key Management
Function address. The UE shall include the default EPS bearer identity
of the PDN connection associated with the remote UE connected to the
ProSe UE-to-network relay or disconnected from the ProSe UE-to-network
relay. If the UE allocated an IPv4 address to a remote UE and enabled
UDP usage to the remote UE, the UE shall include in the REMOTE UE REPORT
message the UDP port range assigned to the remote UE in the NAT function
of ProSe layer-3 UE-to-network relay. If the UE allocated an IPv4
address to a remote UE and enabled TCP usage to the remote UE, the UE
shall include in the REMOTE UE REPORT message the TCP port range
assigned to the remote UE in the NAT function of ProSe layer-3
UE-to-network relay.

NOTE: Encrypted IMSI remote UE identities corresponding to different
ProSe Key Management Function addresses need to be reported using
separate REMOTE UE REPORT messages.

[]

Figure 6.6.3.2.1: Remote UE Report procedure

6.6.3.3 Remote UE Report completion by the network

Upon receipt of the REMOTE UE REPORT message, the MME shall send a
REMOTE UE REPORT RESPONSE message to the UE. The MME shall include the
PTI from the REMOTE UE REPORT message.

6.6.3.4 Remote UE Report completion by the UE

Upon receipt of the REMOTE UE REPORT RESPONSE message, the UE shall stop
timer T3493 and enter the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION INACTIVE.

6.6.3.5 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Expiry of timer T3493:

On the first expiry of the timer T3493, the UE shall resend the REMOTE
UE REPORT message and shall reset and restart timer T3493. This
retransmission is repeated two times, i.e. on the third expiry of timer
T3493, the UE shall abort the procedure and release any resources for
this procedure.

NOTE: After the abortion of the Remote UE Report procedure, the Remote
UE Report procedure for the remote UE(s) can be restarted and how to
restart the procedure is left to UE implementation.

6.6.3.6 Abnormal cases on the network side

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

a) Unknown EPS bearer context:

If the EPS bearer identity provided in the REMOTE UE REPORT message
indicates an EPS bearer identity value which does not belong to any
already activated EPS bearer context, the MME shall reply with the ESM
STATUS message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity".

6.6.4 Transport of user data via the control plane procedure

6.6.4.1 General

The purpose of the transport of user data via the control plane
procedure is to transfer user data via the control plane in an
encapsulated form between the UE and the MME.

The procedure may be initiated by the UE or the network when the UE is
in EMM-CONNECTED mode.

The procedure may also be initiated by the UE in EMM-IDLE mode by
including the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message.

6.6.4.2 UE initiated transport of user data via the control plane

Upon receipt of a request to transfer user data via the control plane,
if the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE initiates the procedure by
sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message including the user data to be
sent in the User data container IE (see example in figure 6.6.4.2.1).
The length of the value part of the User data container IE should not
exceed the link MTU size for the respective type of user data (IPv4,
IPv6 or Non-IP). If the user data in the value part of the User data
container IE is an Ethernet frame, then the length of the Ethernet frame
payload should not exceed the Ethernet frame payload MTU size.

NOTE: The recommended maximum size for link MTU is 1358 octets to
prevent fragmentation in the backbone network (see 3GPP TS 23.060 [74]).
Depending on the network configuration, setting link MTU size to a value
larger than 1358 octets could lead to inefficient core network
implementation due to fragmentation.

If the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE initiates the procedure by sending
the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message included in a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE
REQUEST message.

Based on information provided by the upper layers, the UE may include a
Release assistance indication IE in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message to
inform the network that

1) subsequent to the current uplink data transmission no further uplink
or downlink data transmission (e.g. an acknowledgement or response) is
expected; i.e. the upper layers indicated that data exchanges have
completed with the current UL data transfer; or

2) subsequent to the current uplink data transmission only a single
downlink data transmission and no further uplink data transmission is
expected; i.e. the upper layers indicated that data exchanges will have
completed with the next downlink data transmission.

When receiving the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message, the MME shall identify
the PDN connection to the SCEF or to the PDN GW, based on the EPS bearer
identity included in message, and forward the contents of the User data
container IE accordingly. If the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message includes a
Release assistance indication IE, then ESM layer indicates to the EMM
layer to initiate release of the NAS signalling connection,

1) if the release assistance indication indicates that no further uplink
and no further downlink data transmission subsequent to the uplink data
transmission is expected; or

2) upon subsequent delivery of the next received downlink data
transmission to the UE if the release assistance indication indicates
that only a single downlink data transmission and no further uplink data
transmission subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected.

[]

Figure 6.6.4.2.1: UE initiated transport of user data via the control
plane procedure

6.6.4.3 Network initiated transport of user data via the control plane

The network initiates the procedure by sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT
message (see example in figure 6.6.4.3.1). Upon receiving the ESM DATA
TRANSPORT message, the UE shall:

- forward the contents of the User data container IE to the upper
layers.

[]

Figure 6.6.4.3.1: Network initiated transport of user data via the
control plane procedure

6.6.4.4 Abnormal cases in the UE

The following abnormal case can be identified:

a) T3396 is running

The UE shall not send an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message unless

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN; or

- the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message is used for an exception data reporting
and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the
ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or the USIM file EF_(NASCONFIG) in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17]).

The ESM DATA TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still necessary, when
timer T3396 expires or is stopped.

b) Transmission failure of the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message indication
from lower layers

If lower layers indicate a TAI change and the current TAI is not in the
TAI list, the transport of user data via the control plane procedure
shall be aborted and re-initiated after successfully performing a
tracking area updating procedure if the control plane CIoT EPS
optimisation is still used and the user data exists. The "signalling
active" flag shall be set in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

If lower layers indicate a TAI change, but the current TAI is still part
of the TAI list, or the TAI has not changed, the transport of user data
via the control plane procedure shall be re-initiated immediately if the
user data still exists by including the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message in a
CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.

NOTE: How the ESM sublayer handles the retransmission of user data via
the control plane is up to the UE implementation.

c) NAS MAC calculation indication from lower layers

If lower layers indicate to calculate an NAS MAC, the UE shall calculate
an NAS MAC as specified in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19] and then provide the
calculated NAS MAC and 5 least significant bits of the uplink NAS COUNT
used to calculate the NAS MAC to lower layers (see 3GPP TS 36.331 [22]).
The UE shall increase the uplink NAS COUNT by one after the calculation
of the NAS MAC.

6.6.4.5 Abnormal cases on the network side

a) ESM DATA TRANSPORT message received from a UE which is in a location
where the PLMN is not allowed to operate

If the MME determines that the UE is in a location where the PLMN is not
allowed to operate, the MME discards the message.

6.7 Reception of an ESM STATUS message by an ESM entity

The purpose of the sending of the ESM STATUS message is to report at any
time certain error conditions detected upon receipt of ESM protocol
data. The ESM STATUS message can be sent by both the MME and the UE (see
example in figure 6.7.1).

If the ESM entity of the UE receives an ESM STATUS message the UE shall
take different actions depending on the received ESM cause value:

#43 (Invalid EPS bearer identity);

The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received EPS
bearer identity, stop any related timer, and deactivate the
corresponding EPS bearer context locally (without peer to peer
signalling between the UE and the MME).

#81 (Invalid PTI value);

The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received PTI
value and stop any related timer.

#97 (Message type non-existent or not implemented);

The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the PTI or EPS
bearer identity and stop any related timer.

On receipt of an ESM STATUS message with any other ESM cause value no
state transition and no specific action shall be taken as seen from the
radio interface, i.e. local actions are possible.

If the ESM entity of the MME receives an ESM STATUS message the MME
shall take different actions depending on the received ESM cause value:

#43 (Invalid EPS bearer identity);

The MME shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received
EPS bearer identity, stop any related timer, and deactivate the
corresponding EPS bearer context locally (without peer to peer
signalling between the MME and the UE).

#81 (Invalid PTI value);

The MME shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received
PTI value and stop any related timer.

#97 (Message type non-existent or not implemented);

The MME shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the PTI or EPS
bearer identity and stop any related timer.

The local actions to be taken by the MME on receipt of an ESM STATUS
message with any other ESM cause value are implementation dependent.

7 Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data

7.1 General

The procedures specified in the present document apply to those messages
which pass the checks described in this clause.

This clause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown,
unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. These
procedures are called "error handling procedures", but in addition to
providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a
compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.

Clauses 7.1 to 7.8 shall be applied in order of precedence.

Most error handling procedures are mandatory for the UE.

Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation
dependent and may vary from PLMN to PLMN. However, when extensions of
this protocol are developed, networks will be assumed to have the error
handling that is indicated in this clause as mandatory ("shall") and
that is indicated as strongly recommended ("should").

Also, the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory
or strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not
reached during a dedicated connection.

For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see
3GPP TS 24.007 [12], clause 11.4.2.

7.2 Message too short

When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete

The following network procedures shall apply for handling an unknown,
erroneous, or unforeseen PTI received in an ESM message:

a) If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with an
unassigned or reserved PTI value, the network shall respond with a PDN
CONNECTIVITY REJECT message including ESM cause #81 "invalid PTI value".

b) If the network receives a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST message with an
unassigned or reserved PTI value, the network shall respond with a PDN
DISCONNECT REJECT message including ESM cause #81 "invalid PTI value".

message including ESM cause #81 "invalid PTI value". If the PTI is an
assigned value that does not match any PTI in use, the UE shall respond
with an ESM STATUS message including ESM cause #47 "PTI mismatch".

g) If the UE receives an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST
message in which the PTI value is an assigned value that does not match
any PTI in use, if the UE detects that this request is a network
retransmission of an already accepted request (see clause 6.5.1.3) the
UE shall respond with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT
message. Otherwise, the UE shall respond with an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message including ESM cause #47 "PTI mismatch".

message which contains a reserved PTI value, the UE shall respond with
an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message including ESM
cause #81 "invalid PTI value".

k) If the UE receives a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message in
which the PTI value is an assigned value that does not match any PTI in
use, if the UE detects that this request is a network retransmission of
an already accepted request (see clauses 6.5.3.3 and 6.5.4.3) the UE
shall respond with a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message.
Otherwise, the UE shall respond with a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT
message including ESM cause #47 "PTI mismatch".

l) If the UE receives a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message which

through m with a reserved PTI value or an assigned value that does not
match any PTI in use, the UE shall ignore the message.

7.3.2 EPS bearer identity

The following network procedures shall apply for handling an unknown,
erroneous, or unforeseen EPS bearer identity received in the header of
an ESM message (specified as the header of a standard L3 message, see
3GPP TS 24.007 [12]):

a) If the network receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message which

ESM STATUS message including ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer
identity".

g) If the network receives an ESM message other than those listed in
items a through e above in which the message includes a reserved EPS
bearer identity value or an assigned value that does not match an
existing EPS bearer context, the network shall ignore the message.

The following UE procedures shall apply for handling an unknown,
erroneous, or unforeseen EPS bearer identity received in the header of
an ESM message:

a) If the UE receives a PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT message which includes
an assigned or reserved EPS bearer identity value, the UE shall ignore
the message.

b) If the UE receives a PDN DISCONNECT REJECT message which includes an
assigned or reserved EPS bearer identity value, the UE shall ignore the
message.

c) If the UE receives a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message which

l) If the UE receives an ESM message other than those listed in items a
through j in which the message includes an unassigned or reserved EPS
bearer identity value or a value that does not match an EPS bearer
context of an established PDN connection, the UE shall ignore the
message.

7.4 Unknown or unforeseen message type

If UE receives an EMM message or ESM message with message type not
defined for the protocol discriminator (PD) or not implemented by the
receiver, it shall return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS
depending on the PD) with cause #97 "message type non-existent or not
implemented".

If the network receives an EMM or ESM message with message type not
defined for the PD or not implemented by the receiver in a protocol
state where reception of an unsolicited message with the given PD from
the UE is not foreseen in the protocol, the network actions are
implementation dependent. Otherwise, if the network receives a message
with message type not defined for the PD or not implemented by the
receiver, it shall ignore the message except that it should return a
status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on the PD) with cause
#97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".

NOTE: A message type not defined for the PD in the given direction is
regarded by the receiver as a message type not defined for the PD, see
3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

If the UE receives a message not compatible with the protocol state, the
UE shall return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on
the PD) with cause #98 "message type not compatible with protocol
state".

If the network receives a message not compatible with the protocol
state, the network actions are implementation dependent.

7.5 Non-semantical mandatory information element errors

7.5.1 Common procedures

When on receipt of a message,

- an "imperative message part" error; or

- a "missing mandatory IE" error

is diagnosed or when a message containing:

- a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE;

- an IE unknown in the message, but encoded as "comprehension required"
(see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]); or

- an out of sequence IE encoded as "comprehension required" (see
3GPP TS 24.007 [12]) is received,

the UE shall proceed as follows:

- If the message is not one of the messages listed in clause 7.5.3, item
a, b, c, or d, the UE shall return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM
STATUS depending on the PD) with cause #96 "invalid mandatory
information"; and

the network shall proceed as follows:

- If the message is not one of the messages listed in clause 7.5.3, item
e, f, g or h, the network shall either:

- try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation
dependent); or

- ignore the message except that it should return a status message (EMM
STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on the PD) with cause #96 "invalid
mandatory information".

7.5.2 EPS mobility management

No exceptional cases are described for mobility management messages.

No semantical or syntactical diagnosis other than presence and length
shall be performed on the ESM message container information element in
the ATTACH REQUEST, ATTACH ACCEPT, ATTACH COMPLETE and CONTROL PLANE
SERVICE REQUEST messages.

7.5.3 EPS session management

The following UE procedures shall apply for handling an error
encountered with a mandatory information element in an ESM message:

a) If the message is an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, an
ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause #96
"invalid mandatory information", shall be returned.

b) If the message is an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST,
an ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause
#96 "invalid mandatory information", shall be returned.

c) If the message is a MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, a MODIFY EPS
BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause #96 "invalid mandatory
information", shall be returned.

d) If the message is a DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST, a
DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message shall be returned. All
resources associated with that EPS bearer shall be released.

The following network procedures shall apply for handling an error
encountered with a mandatory information element in an ESM message:

a) If the message is a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST, a PDN CONNECTIVITY
REJECT message with ESM cause #96 "invalid mandatory information", shall
be returned.

b) If the message is a PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST, a PDN DISCONNECT REJECT
message with ESM cause #96 "invalid mandatory information", shall be
returned.

c) If the message is a BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST, a BEARER
RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT message with ESM cause #96 "invalid mandatory
information", shall be returned.

d) If the message is a BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST, a BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT message with ESM cause #96 "invalid
mandatory information", shall be returned.

7.6 Unknown and unforeseen IEs in the non-imperative message part

7.6.1 IEIs unknown in the message

The UE shall ignore all IEs unknown in a message which are not encoded
as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]).

The network shall take the same approach.

7.6.2 Out of sequence IEs

The UE shall ignore all out of sequence IEs in a message which are not
encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]).

The network should take the same approach.

7.6.3 Repeated IEs

If an information element with format T, TV, TLV, or TLV-E is repeated
in a message in which repetition of the information element is not
specified in clause 8 of the present document, the UE shall handle only
the contents of the information element appearing first and shall ignore
all subsequent repetitions of the information element. When repetition
of information elements is specified, the UE shall handle only the
contents of specified repeated information elements. If the limit on
repetition of information elements is exceeded, the UE shall handle the
contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of
repetitions and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the
information element.

The network should follow the same procedures.

7.7 Non-imperative message part errors

This category includes:

- syntactically incorrect optional IEs; and

- conditional IE errors.

7.7.1 Syntactically incorrect optional IEs

The UE shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in
a message as not present in the message.

The network shall take the same approach.

7.7.2 Conditional IE errors

When upon receipt of a EMM or ESM message the UE diagnoses a "missing
conditional IE" error or an "unexpected conditional IE" error, or when
it receives a EMM or ESM message containing at least one syntactically
incorrect conditional IE, the UE shall ignore the message and shall
return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on the PD)
with cause #100 "conditional IE error".

When the network receives a message and diagnoses a "missing conditional
IE" error or an "unexpected conditional IE" error or when it receives a
message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE,
the network shall either:

- try to treat the message (the exact further actions are implementation
dependent); or

- ignore the message except that it should return a status message (EMM
STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on the PD) with cause #100 "conditional
IE error".

7.8 Messages with semantically incorrect contents

When a message with semantically incorrect contents is received, the UE
shall perform the foreseen reactions of the procedural part of the
present document (i.e. of clauses 4, 5 and 6). If however no such
reactions are specified, the UE shall ignore the message except that it
shall return a status message (EMM STATUS or ESM STATUS depending on the
PD) with cause #95 "semantically incorrect message".

The network should follow the same procedure except that a status
message is not normally transmitted.

8 Message functional definitions and contents

8.1 Overview

This clause defines the structure of the messages of the Layer 3 (L3)
protocols defined in the present document. These are standard L3
messages as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

Each definition given in the present clause includes:

a) a brief description of the message direction and use, including
whether the message has:

1. Local significance, i.e. relevant only on the originating or
terminating access;

2. Access significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating
access, but not in the network;

3. Dual significance, i.e. relevant in either the originating or
terminating access and in the network; or

4. Global significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating
access and in the network.

b) a table listing the Information Elements (IE) known in the message
and the order of their appearance in the message. All IEs that may be
repeated are explicitly indicated (The V, LV and LV-E formatted IEs,
which compose the imperative part of the message, occur before the T,
TV, TLV and TLV-E formatted IEs which compose the non-imperative part of
the message, see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]). In a (maximal) sequence of
consecutive IEs with half octet length, the first IE with half octet
length occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second IE bits 5 to 8 of
octet N, the third IE bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc. Such a sequence
always has an even number of elements.

For each information element the table indicates:

1. The Information Element Identifier (IEI), in hexadecimal notation, if
the IE has format T, TV, TLV or TLV‑E. If the IEI has half octet length,
it is specified by a notation representing the IEI as a hexadecimal
digit followed by a "-" (example: B-).

NOTE: The same IEI can be used for different information element types
in different messages of the same protocol.

2. The name of the information element (which may give an idea of the
semantics of the element). The name of the information element followed
by "IE" or "information element" is used in this technical report as
reference to the information element within a message.

3. The name of the type of the information element (which indicates the
coding of the value part of the IE), and generally, the referenced
clause of clause 9 of the present document describing the value part of
the information element.

4. The presence requirement indication (M, C, or O) for the IE as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

5. The format of the information element (T, V, TV, LV, TLV, LV-E or
TLV-E) as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

6. The length of the information element (or permissible range of
lengths), in octets, in the message, where "?" means that the maximum
length of the IE is only constrained by link layer protocol. This
indication is non-normative.

c) clauses specifying, where appropriate, conditions for IEs with
presence requirement C or O in the relevant message which together with
other conditions specified in the present document define when the
information elements shall be included or not, what non-presence of such
IEs means, and – for IEs with presence requirement C – the static
conditions for presence or non-presence of the IEs or for both cases
(see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]).

8.2 EPS mobility management messages

(protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or
messages/events) to the UE and the extended protocol configuration
options is supported by both the UE and the network end-to-end for the
PDN connection (see clause 6.6.1.1).

This IE shall be included if the network supports Local IP address in
the traffic flow aggregate description and TFT filter, the PDN Type is
different from Non-IP and Ethernet, and the extended protocol
configuration options is supported by both the UE and the network
end-to-end for the PDN connection (see clause 6.6.1.1).

for the indicated traffic flows and does not request to release all
bearer resources for the EPS bearer context.

8.3.10.3 ESM cause

This IE is included in the message when the UE requests the release of a
dedicated bearer resource.

8.3.10.4 Protocol configuration options

This IE is included in the message when the UE wishes to transmit
(protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or
messages/events) to the network and the extended protocol configuration
options is not supported by the UE or the network end-to-end for the PDN
connection (see clause 6.6.1.1).

This IE is included in the message if:

a) the UE wishes to re-negotiate header compression configuration
associated to an EPS bearer context and both the UE and the network
supports Control plane CIoT EPS optimization and header compression; or

b) to negotiate header compression configuration associated to an EPS
bearer context after an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode when
both the UE and the network support control plane CIoT EPS optimization
and header compression, and the UE is operating in single-registration
mode and has received the interworking without N26 interface indicator
set to "interworking without N26 interface not supported" from the
network.

8.3.10.8 Extended protocol configuration options

This IE is included in the message when the UE wishes to transmit
(protocol) data (e.g. configuration parameters, error codes or

8.3.25.2 Release assistance indication

The UE may include this IE to inform the network whether

- no further uplink and no further downlink data transmission is
expected; or

- only a single downlink data transmission (e.g. acknowledgement or
response to uplink data) and no further uplink data transmission
subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected.

9 General message format and information elements coding

9.1 Overview

Within the protocols defined in the present document, every message,
except the SERVICE REQUEST message, is a standard L3 message as defined
in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]. This means that the message consists of the
following parts:

1) if the message is a plain NAS message:

a) protocol discriminator;

b) EPS bearer identity or security header type;

c) procedure transaction identity;

d) message type;

e) other information elements, as required.

2) if the message is a security protected NAS message:

a) protocol discriminator;

b) security header type;

c) message authentication code;

d) sequence number;

e) plain NAS message, as defined in item 1.

The organization of a plain NAS message is illustrated in the example
shown in figure 9.1.1.

Figure 9.1.2: General message organization example for a security
protected NAS message

The EPS bearer identity and the procedure transaction identity are only
used in messages with protocol discriminator EPS session management.
Octet 1a with the procedure transaction identity shall only be included
in these messages.

Unless specified otherwise in the message descriptions of clause 8, a
particular information element shall not be present more than once in a
given message.

When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values
progressively decreases as the octet number increases. The most
significant bit of the field is represented by the highest numbered bit
of the lowest numbered octet of the field. The least significant bit of
the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest
numbered octet of the field.

9.2 Protocol discriminator

The Protocol Discriminator (PD) and its use are defined in
3GPP TS 24.007 [12]. The protocol discriminator in the header (see
3GPP TS 24.007 [12]) of a security protected NAS message is encoded as
"EPS mobility management messages".

9.3 Security header type and EPS bearer identity

9.3.1 Security header type

Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every EPS Mobility Management (EMM)
message contain the Security header type IE. This IE includes control
information related to the security protection of a NAS message. The
total size of the Security header type IE is 4 bits.

The Security header type IE can take the values shown in table 9.3.1.

An EMM message received with the security header type encoded as 0000
shall be treated as not security protected, plain NAS message. A
protocol entity sending a not security protected EMM message shall send
the message as plain NAS message and encode the security header type as
0000.

9.3.2 EPS bearer identity

Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every EPS Session Management (ESM)
message contain the EPS bearer identity. The EPS bearer identity and its
use to identify a message flow are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

If the UE or the MME or both do not support signalling for a maximum
number of 15 EPS bearer contexts, the MME shall select the EPS bearer
identity from the value range 5 to 15, or select the value 0 when it
needs to indicate that no EPS bearer identity is assigned.

NOTE: When assigning EPS bearer identities from the range 1 to 4, the
MME can take into account that these EPS bearer contexts will be subject
to local deactivation if the UE performs inter-system change to A/Gb
mode or Iu mode or if it performs a change to an MME not supporting
signalling for a maximum number of 15 EPS bearer contexts.

9.4 Procedure transaction identity

Bits 1 to 8 of the second octet (octet 1a) of every EPS Session
Management (ESM) message contain the procedure transaction identity. The
procedure transaction identity and its use are defined in
3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

9.5 Message authentication code

The Message authentication code (MAC) information element contains the
integrity protection information for the message. The MAC IE shall be
included in the security protected NAS message if a valid EPS security
context exists and security functions are started. The usage of MAC is
specified in clause 4.4.3.3.

9.6 Sequence number

This IE includes the NAS message sequence number (SN) which consists of
the eight least significant bits of the NAS COUNT for a security
protected NAS message. The usage of SN is specified in clause 4.4.3.

9.7 NAS message

This IE includes a complete plain NAS message as specified in clause 8.2
and 8.3. The SECURITY PROTECTED NAS MESSAGE and the SERVICE REQUEST
message are not plain NAS messages and shall not be included in this IE.

9.8 Message type

The message type IE and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].
Tables 9.8.1 and 9.8.2 define the value part of the message type IE used
in the EPS mobility management protocol and EPS session management
protocol.

9.9 Other information elements

9.9.1 General

The different formats (V, LV, T, TV, TLV, LV-E, TLV-E) and the five
categories of information elements (type 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6) are defined
in 3GPP TS 24.007 [12].

The first octet of an information element in the non-imperative part
contains the IEI of the information element. If this octet does not
correspond to an IEI known in the message, the receiver shall determine
whether this IE is of type 1 or 2 (i.e. it is an information element of
one octet length), an IE of type 4 (i.e. that the next octet is the
length indicator indicating the length of the remaining of the
information element or an IE of type 6 (i.e. that the next 2 octets are
the length indicator indicating the length of the remaining of the
information element) (see 3GPP TS 24.007 [12]).

This allows the receiver to jump over unknown information elements and
to analyse any following information elements.

The definitions of information elements which are common for the EMM and
ESM protocols or which are used by access stratum protocols are
described in clause 9.9.2.

The information elements of the EMM or ESM protocols can be defined by
reference to an appropriate specification, e.g., "see clause 10.5.6.3 in
3GPP TS 24.008 [13]".

9.9.2 Common information elements

9.9.2.0 Additional information

The purpose of the Additional information information element is to
provide additional information to upper layers in relation to the
generic NAS message transport mechanism.

The Additional information information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.2.0.1 and table 9.9.2.0.1.

The Additional information is a type 4 information element with a
minimum length of 3 octets.

9.9.2.1 EPS bearer context status

The purpose of the EPS bearer context status information element is to
indicate the state of each EPS bearer context that can be identified by
an EPS bearer identity.

The EPS bearer context status information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.2.1.1 and table 9.9.2.1.1.

The EPS bearer context status information element is a type 4
information element with 4 octets length.

9.9.3.12A EPS network feature support

The purpose of the EPS network feature support information element is to
indicate whether certain features are supported by the network.

The EPS network feature support information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.3.12A.1 and table 9.9.3.12A.1.

The EPS network feature support is a type 4 information element with a
minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum length of 5 octets.

If the network does not include octet 4 or octet 5 as defined below in
the present version of the protocol, then the UE shall interpret this as
a receipt of an information element with all bits of octet 4 and 5 coded
as zero.

9.9.3.33 Tracking area identity list

The purpose of the Tracking area identity list information element is to
transfer a list of tracking areas from the network to the UE.

The coding of the information element allows combining different types
of lists. The lists of type "00" and "01" allow a more compact encoding,
when the different TAIs are sharing the PLMN identity.

The Tracking area identity list information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.3.33.1, figure 9.9.3.33.2, figure 9.9.3.33.3,
figure 9.9.3.33.4 and table 9.9.3.33.1.

The Tracking area identity list is a type 4 information element, with a
minimum length of 8 octets and a maximum length of 98 octets. The list
can contain a maximum of 16 different tracking area identities.

9.9.3.34 UE network capability

The purpose of the UE network capability information element is to
provide the network with information concerning aspects of the UE
related to EPS or interworking with GPRS and 5GS. The contents might
affect the manner in which the network handles the operation of the UE.
The UE network capability information indicates general UE
characteristics and it shall therefore, except for fields explicitly
indicated, be independent of the frequency band of the channel it is
sent on.

The UE network capability information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.3.34.1 and table 9.9.3.34.1.

The UE network capability is a type 4 information element with a minimum
length of 4 octets and a maximum length of 15 octets.

NOTE: The requirements for the support of UMTS security algorithms in
the UE are specified in 3GPP TS 33.102 [18], and the requirements for
the support of EPS security algorithms in 3GPP TS 33.401 [19].

9.9.3.36 UE security capability

The UE security capability information element is used by the network to
indicate which security algorithms are supported by the UE in S1 mode,
Iu mode and Gb mode. Security algorithms supported in S1 mode are
supported both for NAS and for AS security. If the UE supports S101
mode, then these security algorithms are also supported for NAS security
in S101 mode.

The UE security capability information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.3.36.1 and table 9.9.3.36.1.

The UE security capability is a type 4 information element with a
minimum length of 4 octets and a maximum length of 7 octets.

Octets 5, 6, and 7 are optional. If octet 5 is included, then also octet
6 shall be included and octet 7 may be included.

If a UE did not indicate support of any security algorithm for Gb mode,
octet 7 shall not be included. If the UE did not indicate support of any
security algorithm for Iu mode and Gb mode, octets 5, 6, and 7 shall not
be included.

If the UE did not indicate support of any security algorithm for Iu mode
but indicated support of a security algorithm for Gb mode, octets 5, 6,
and 7 shall be included. In this case octets 5 and 6 are filled with the
value of zeroes.

9.9.3.37 Emergency Number List

See clause 10.5.3.13 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

9.9.3.37A Extended emergency number list

The purpose of this information element is to encode one or more local
emergency number(s) together with a sub-services field containing zero
or more sub-services of the associated emergency service URN and a
validity indication. An emergency service URN is a service URN with top
level service type of "sos" as specified in IETF RFC 5031 [55].

EXAMPLE 1: If the associated emergency service URN is
"urn:service:sos.gas", there is only one sub-service provided in the
sub-services field which is "gas".

EXAMPLE 2: If the associated emergency service URN is "urn:service:sos",
there is no sub-services provided in the sub-services field and the
length of the sub-services field is "0".

NOTE: The associated emergency service URN can be a country-specific
emergency service URN as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [13D].

The Extended emergency number list information element is coded as shown
in figure 9.9.3.37A.1 and table 9.9.3.37A.1.

The Extended emergency number list IE is a type 6 information element
with a minimum length of 7 octets and a maximum length of 65538 octets.

[TABLE]

NOTE 1: The length shall contain the number of octets used to encode the
number digits.

NOTE 2: The number digit(s) in octet 6 precedes the digit(s) in octet 7
etc. The number digit, which would be entered first, is located in octet
6, bits 1 to 4. The contents of the number digits are coded as shown in
table 10.5.118/3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

NOTE 3: If the emergency number contains an odd number of digits, bits 5
to 8 of the last octet of the respective emergency number shall be
filled with an end mark coded as "1111".

NOTE 4: The length shall contain the number of octets used to encode the
sub-services field.

NOTE 5: The characters of the sub-services of the associated emergency
service URN shall be coded in accordance to GSM 7 bit default alphabet
and the appropriate padding characters and bit-fill are added to octet
boundary as specified in clause 6.1.2.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.038 [3]and the
first character starts in octet j+1, l+1 or n+1.

Figure 9.9.3.37A.1 Extended Emergency Number List IE

EXAMPLE 3: If the associated emergency service URN is
"urn:service:sos.police.municipal", the sub-services field contains
"police.municipal" and the first character is "p".

9.9.3.51 Replayed NAS message container

The purpose of the Replayed NAS message container IE is to, during an
ongoing attach or tracking area updating procedure, re-send the ATTACH
REQUEST or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with which the UE had
initiated the procedure, if the MME has included a HASH_(MME) in the
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message and the HASH_(MME) is different from the
hash value locally calculated at the UE as described in
3GPP TS 33.401 [19]. If an ATTACH REQUEST message is included in this
IE, the ATTACH REQUEST message shall be coded as specified in
clause 8.2.4, i.e. without NAS security header. If a TRACKING AREA
UPDATE REQUEST message is included in this IE, the TRACKING AREA UPDATE
REQUEST message shall be coded as specified in clause 8.2.29, i.e.
without NAS security header

The Replayed NAS message container information element is coded as shown
in figure 9.9.3.51.1 and table 9.9.3.51.1.

The Replayed NAS message container is a type 6 information element.

9.9.3.63 NB-S1 DRX parameter

The purpose of the NB-S1 DRX parameter information element is to
indicate that the UE intends to use the UE specific DRX parameter in
NB-S1 mode and for the network to indicate the negotiated UE specific
DRX parameter to be used at paging in NB-S1 mode.

The NB-S1 DRX parameters information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.3.63.1 and table 9.9.3.63.1.

The NB-S1 DRX parameters is a type 4 information element with a length
of 3 octets.

9.9.4 EPS Session Management (ESM) information elements

9.9.4.1 Access point name

See clause 10.5.6.1 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

9.9.4.2 APN aggregate maximum bit rate

The purpose of the APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element is
to indicate the initial subscribed APN-AMBR when the UE establishes a
PDN connection or to indicate the new APN-AMBR if it is changed by the
network.

The APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element is coded as shown
in figure 9.9.4.2.1 and table 9.9.4.2.1.

The APN aggregate maximum bit rate is a type 4 information element with
a minimum length of 4 octets and a maximum length of 8 octets. Octets
5-8 are optional. If octet 5 is included, then octet 6 shall also be
included, and octets 7-8 may be included. If octet 7 is included, then
octet 8 shall also be included. The length of the APN-AMBR IE can be
either 4 octets, 6 octets or 8 octets.

9.9.4.2A Connectivity type

See clause 10.5.6.19 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

9.9.4.3 EPS quality of service

The purpose of the EPS quality of service information element is to
specify the QoS parameters for an EPS bearer context.

The EPS quality of service information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.4.3.1 and table 9.9.4.3.1.

The EPS quality of service is a type 4 information element with a
minimum length of 3 octets and a maximum length of 15 octets. Octets
4-15 are optional. If octet 4 is included, then octets 5-7 shall also be
included, and octets 8-15 may be included. If octet 8 is included, then
octets 4-11 shall also be included, and octets 12-15 may be included. If
octet 12 is included, then octets 4-15 shall also be included. The
length of the EPS QoS IE can be either 3 octets, 7 octets, 11 octets or
15 octets.

Refer to 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] for a detailed description of the QoS Class
Identifier (QCI).

9.9.4.14 Request type

See clause 10.5.6.17 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

9.9.4.15 Traffic flow aggregate description

The purpose of the Traffic flow aggregate description information
element is to specify the aggregate of one of more packet filters and
their related parameters and operations. The traffic flow aggregate
description may contain the aggregate of packet filters for the downlink
direction, the uplink direction or packet filters that apply for both
directions. The packet filters determine the traffic mapping to EPS
bearer contexts. The downlink packet filters shall be applied by the
network, and the uplink packet filters shall be applied by the UE. A
packet filter that applies for both directions shall be applied by the
network as a downlink packet filter and by the UE as an uplink packet
filter.

When the traffic flow aggregate description is used in the UE requested
bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE requested bearer resource
modification procedure, it is associated to a particular procedure
identified by a procedure transaction identity (PTI). Therefore, the UE
shall release the traffic flow aggregate description when the UE
requested bearer resource allocation procedure or the UE requested
bearer resource modification procedure is completed. The UE shall not
include the packet filters of a particular traffic flow aggregate
description in any other traffic flow aggregate description when
multiple UE requested bearer resource allocation procedures and/or UE
requested bearer resource modification procedures are ongoing in
parallel.

The Traffic flow aggregate description information element is encoded
using the same format as the Traffic flow template (TFT) information
element (see clause 10.5.6.12 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13]). When sending this
IE in the BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REQUEST message or the BEARER
RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message, the UE shall set the packet
filter identifier values to 0 when the UE requests to "Create a new TFT"
or "Add packet filters to existing TFT" ; otherwise, the UE shall set
the packet filter identifier values from those of already assigned
packet filter identifiers of the existing EPS bearer, so that they are
unique across all packet filters for the EPS bearer context indicated by
the EPS bearer identity IE.

9.9.4.16 Traffic flow template

See clause 10.5.6.12 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

9.9.4.17 Transaction identifier

The purpose of the Transaction identifier information element is to
represent the corresponding PDP context in A/Gb mode or Iu mode which is
mapped from the EPS bearer context.

The Transaction identifier information element is coded as the Linked TI
information element in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13], clause 10.5.6.7.

9.9.4.18 WLAN offload acceptability

See clause 10.5.6.20 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [13].

9.9.4.19 NBIFOM container

See clause 10.5.6.21 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [4].

9.9.4.20 Remote UE context list

The purpose of the Remote UE context list information element is to
provide identity and optionally IP address of a remote UE connected to,
or disconnected from, a UE acting as a ProSe UE-to-network relay.

The Remote UE context list information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.4.20.1 and table 9.9.4.20.1.

The Remote UE context list is a type 6 information element with a
minimum length of 5 octets and a maximum length of 65538 octets.

If Address type indicates IPv4, the Address information in octet 4 to
octet 7 contains the IPv4 address. Bit 8 of octet 4 represents the most
significant bit of the IP address and bit 1 of octet 7 the least
significant bit.

If Address type indicates IPv6, the Address information in octet 4 to
octet 19 contains the IPv6 address. Bit 8 of octet 4 represents the most
significant bit of the IP address and bit 1 of octet 19 the least
significant bit.

9.9.4.22 Header compression configuration

The purpose of the Header compression configuration information element
is to negotiate ROHC channel setup parameters specified in
IETF RFC 5795 [37] and, optionally, provide additional header
compression context setup parameters.

The Header compression configuration information element is coded as
shown in figure 9.9.4.22.1 and table 9.9.4.22.1.

The Header compression configuration is a type 4 information element
with a minimum length of 5 octets and a maximum length of 257 octets.

The optional Additional header compression parameters container field
conveys the additional header compression context setup parameters as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [10] in a generic container. This field
corresponds to the profile-specific information in the header of the
ROHC IR packet type in IETF RFC 5795 [37].

Figure 9.9.4.28.1: Serving PLMN rate control information element

Serving PLMN rate control value (octet 3 to octet 4) is a binary encoded
integer indicating the maximum number of uplink ESM DATA TRANSPORT
messages including User data container IEs the UE is allowed to send per
6 minute interval. The Serving PLMN rate control value is an integer
equal to or higher than 10. The Serving PLMN rate control value FFFFH
indicates that the maximum number of uplink ESM DATA TRANSPORT messages
including User data container IEs the UE is allowed to send per 6 minute
interval is not restricted.

9.9.4.29 Extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate

The purpose of the extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate information
element is to indicate the initial subscribed APN-AMBR with a value
higher than 65280 Mbps when the UE establishes a PDN connection or to
indicate the new APN-AMBR with a value higher than 65280 Mbps if it is
changed by the network.

The receiving entity shall ignore the bit rate values which are included
in the extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element and
not higher than 65280 Mbps.

The extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate information element is coded
as shown in figure 9.9.4.29.1 and table 9.9.4.29.1.

The extended APN aggregate maximum bit rate is a type 4 information
element with a length of 8 octets.

9.9.4.30 Extended quality of service

The purpose of the Extended quality of service information element is to
indicate for an EPS bearer context the maximum bit rates for uplink and
downlink and the guaranteed bit rates for uplink and downlink, if at
least one of the bit rates has a value higher than 10 Gbps.

The Extended quality of service information element is coded as shown in
figure 9.9.4.30.1 and table 9.9.4.30.1. For uplink and downlink, if the
sending entity only has to indicate one bit rate (i.e. with a value
higher than 10 Gbps), it shall encode the other bit rate (i.e., with a
value smaller or equal to 10 Gbps) as "00000000". The receiving entity
shall ignore a bit rate which is included in the extended quality of
service information element and has a value smaller or equal to 10 Gbps.

The Extended quality of service is a type 4 information element with a
length of 12 octets.

NOTE 1: The back-off timer is used to describe a logical model of the
required UE behaviour. This model does not imply any specific
implementation, e.g. as a timer or timestamp.

NOTE 2: Reference to back-off timer in this section can either refer to
use of timer T3396 or to use of a different packet system specific timer
within the UE. Whether the UE uses T3396 as a back-off timer or it uses
different packet system specific timers as back-off timers is left up to
UE implementation.

 Annex A (informative): Cause values for EPS mobility management

A.1 Causes related to UE identification

Cause #2 – IMSI unknown in HSS

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the UE is not known (registered) in
the HSS or if the UE has packet only subscription. This EMM cause does
not affect operation of the EPS service, although it may be used by an
EMM procedure.

Cause #3 – Illegal UE

This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network refuses service to the
UE either because an identity of the UE is not acceptable to the network
or because the UE does not pass the authentication check, i.e. the RES
received from the UE is different from that generated by the network.

Cause #6 – Illegal ME

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the ME used is not acceptable to the
network, e.g. on the prohibited list.

Cause #9 – UE identity cannot be derived by the network.

This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network cannot derive the UE's
identity from the GUTI/S-TMSI/P-TMSI and RAI e.g. no matching
identity/context in the network or failure to validate the UE's identity
due to integrity check failure of the received message.

Cause #10 – Implicitly detached

This EMM cause is sent to the UE either if the network has implicitly
detached the UE, e.g. after the implicit detach timer has expired, or if
the EMM context data related to the subscription does not exist in the
MME e.g. because of a MME restart, or because of a periodic tracking
area update request routed to a new MME.

A.2 Cause related to subscription options

Cause #5 – IMEI not accepted

This cause is sent to the UE if the network does not accept an attach
procedure for emergency bearer services using an IMEI.

Cause #7 – EPS services not allowed

This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate EPS
services.

Cause #8 – EPS services and non-EPS services not allowed

This EMM cause is sent to the UE when it is not allowed to operate
either EPS or non-EPS services.

Cause #11 – PLMN not allowed

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the
network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN where the UE, by
subscription or due to operator determined barring, is not allowed to
operate.

Cause #12 – Tracking area not allowed

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the
network initiates a detach request, in a tracking area where the HPLMN
determines that the UE, by subscription, is not allowed to operate.

NOTE 1: If EMM cause #12 is sent to a roaming subscriber the subscriber
is denied service even if other PLMNs are available on which
registration was possible.

Cause #13 – Roaming not allowed in this tracking area

This EMM cause is sent to an UE which requests service, or if the
network initiates a detach request, in a tracking area of a PLMN which
by subscription offers roaming to that UE but not in that tracking area.

Cause #14 – EPS services not allowed in this PLMN

This EMM cause is sent to the UE which requests service, or if the
network initiates a detach request, in a PLMN which does not offer
roaming for EPS services to that UE.

NOTE 2: Since only one list of forbidden PLMNs for packet services is
maintained in the UE, then the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" is the
maintained list and the forbidden PLMNs for EPS service is equivalent to
it.

Cause #15 – No suitable cells in tracking area

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service, or if the
network initiates a detach request, in a tracking area where the UE, by
subscription, is not allowed to operate, but when it should find another
allowed tracking area or location area in the same PLMN or an equivalent
PLMN.

NOTE 3: Cause #15 and cause #12 differ in the fact that cause #12 does
not trigger the UE to search for another allowed tracking area on the
same PLMN.

Cause #25 – Not authorized for this CSG

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests access, or if the
network initiates a detach request, in a CSG cell with CSG ID where the
UE either has no subscription to operate or the UE's subscription has
expired and it should find another cell in the same PLMN or an
equivalent PLMN.

Cause #35 – Requested service option not authorized in this PLMN

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests in a PLMN a service
option for which it is not authorized, e.g. if it attempts to attach for
relay node operation in a PLMN with a USIM which does not belong to a
relay node-specific subscription.

Cause #36 – IAB-node operation not authorized

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if a UE operating as an IAB-node
requests service, or if the network initiates a detach request, in a
PLMN where the UE, by subscription, is not authorized for IAB operation.

Cause #40 – No EPS bearer context activated

This EMM cause is sent to the UE, if during a tracking area updating
procedure or a service request, the MME detects that there is no active
EPS bearer context in the network.

Cause #31 – Redirection to 5GCN required

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests service in a PLMN where
the UE by operator policy, is not allowed in EPC and redirection to 5GCN
is required.

A.3 Causes related to PLMN specific network failures and congestion/authentication failures

Cause #16 – MSC temporarily not reachable

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if it requests a combined EPS attach or
tracking area updating in a PLMN where the MSC is temporarily not
reachable via the EPS part of the network.

Cause #17 – Network failure

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE
generated request because of PLMN failures.

Cause #18 – CS domain not available

This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the MME cannot service an UE
generated request because CS domain is not available and SMS in MME is
not supported.

Cause #19 – ESM failure

This EMM cause is sent to the UE when there is a failure in the ESM
message contained in the EMM message.

Cause #20 – MAC failure

This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the MAC
in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is not fresh (see
3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

Cause #21 – Synch failure

This EMM cause is sent to the network if the USIM detects that the SQN
in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is out of range (see
3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

Cause #22 – Congestion

This EMM cause is sent to the UE because of congestion in the network
(e.g. no channel, facility busy/congested etc.).

Cause #23 – UE security capabilities mismatch

This EMM cause is sent to the network if the UE detects that the UE
security capability does not match the one sent back by the network.

Cause #24 – Security mode rejected, unspecified

This EMM cause is sent to the network if the security mode command is
rejected by the UE if the UE detects that the nonce_(UE) does not match
the one sent back by the network or for unspecified reasons.

Cause #26 – Non-EPS authentication unacceptable

This EMM cause is sent to the network in S1 mode if the "separation bit"
in the AMF field of AUTN is set to 0 in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST
message (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

Cause #39 – CS service temporarily not available

This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the CS fallback or 1xCS fallback
request cannot be served temporarily due to O&M reasons or a mobile
terminating CS fallback call is aborted by the network during call
establishment (see 3GPP TS 29.118 [16A]).

Cause #42 – Severe network failure

This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network has determined that
the requested procedure cannot be completed successfully due to network
failure. The failure is not expected to be temporary and repeated
request is not likely to succeed in near future.

Cause #78 –PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location

This EMM cause is sent to the UE to indicate that the PLMN is not
allowed to operate at the present UE location.

NOTE: This cause is only used by the network towards UE in NB-S1 mode or
WB-S1 mode accessing the network through a satellite E-UTRA cell.

A.4 Causes related to nature of request

NOTE: This clause has no entries in this version of the specification

A.5 Causes related to invalid messages

requested service was rejected due to a semantic error in the TFT
operation included in the request.

Cause #42 – Syntactical error in the TFT operation.

This ESM cause is used by the network or the UE to indicate that the
requested service was rejected due to a syntactical error in the TFT
operation included in the request.

Cause #43 – Invalid EPS bearer identity

bearer identity value provided to it is not a valid value for the
received message or the EPS bearer context identified by the linked EPS
bearer identity IE in the request is not active.

Cause #44 – Semantic errors in packet filter(s)

This ESM cause is used by the network or the UE to indicate that the
requested service was rejected due to one or more semantic errors in
packet filter(s) of the TFT included in the request.

Cause #45 – Syntactical error in packet filter(s)

This ESM cause is used by the network or the UE to indicate that the
requested service was rejected due to one or more syntactical errors in

from a non-3GPP access network connected to EPC, or at interworking of a
PDU session from non-3GPP access network connected to 5GCN or from
NG-RAN connected to 5GCN to a PDN connection, to indicate that the MME
does not have any information about the requested PDN connection.

Cause #55 – Multiple PDN connections for a given APN not allowed

This ESM cause is used by the network to indicate that the PDN
connectivity procedure was rejected due to multiple PDN connections for
a given APN are not allowed.

Cause #56 – Collision with network initiated request

Cause #112 – APN restriction value incompatible with active EPS bearer
context.

This ESM cause is used by the network to indicate that the EPS bearer
context(s) have an APN restriction value that is not allowed in
combination with a currently active EPS bearer context. Restriction
values are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [4].

Cause #113 – Multiple accesses to a PDN connection not allowed

This ESM cause is used by the network to indicate that multiple accesses
to a PDN connection for NBIFOM is not allowed.

B.2 Protocol errors (e.g., unknown message) class

Cause #95 – Semantically incorrect message

This ESM cause is used to report receipt of a message with semantically
incorrect contents.

 Annex C (normative): Storage of EMM information

The following EMM parameters shall be stored on the USIM if the
corresponding file is present:

- GUTI;

- last visited registered TAI;

- EPS update status;

- Allowed CSG list;

- Operator CSG list; and

- EPS security context parameters from a full native EPS security
context (see 3GPP TS 33.401 [19]).

The presence and format of corresponding files on the USIM is specified
in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

If the corresponding file is not present on the USIM, these EMM
parameters except allowed CSG list are stored in a non-volatile memory
in the ME together with the IMSI from the USIM. The allowed CSG list is
stored in a non-volatile memory in the ME if the UE supports CSG
selection. These EMM parameters can only be used if the IMSI from the
USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory; else the UE
shall delete the EMM parameters.

The following EMM parameters shall be stored in a non-volatile memory in
the ME together with the IMSI from the USIM:

- TIN;

- DCN-ID list; and

- network-assigned UE radio capability IDs.

The TIN parameter can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the
IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; else the UE shall
delete the TIN parameter.

The DCN-ID list consists of DCN-IDs stored together with a PLMN
identity. The list can have zero or more entries and the maximum length
shall be at least 32 entries. When the maximum length is reached any new
entry shall replace the oldest entry in the list. There shall be no
duplicated PLMN identities in the list and any existing DCN-ID shall be
deleted when a new DCN-ID is added for the same PLMN.

The DCN-ID list can only be used if the IMSI from the USIM matches the
IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the ME; else the UE shall
delete the DCN-ID list. The UE shall delete the stored DCN-ID list if
the default standardized DCN-ID in the UE is changed.

Each network-assigned UE radio capability ID is stored together with a
PLMN identity of the PLMN that provided it as well as a mapping to the
corresponding UE radio configuration, and is valid in that PLMN. A
network-assigned UE radio capability ID can only be used if the IMSI
from the USIM matches the IMSI stored in the non-volatile memory of the
ME, else the UE shall delete the network-assigned UE radio capability
ID. The UE shall be able to store at least the last 16 received
network-assigned UE radio capability IDs. There shall be only one
network-assigned UE radio capability ID stored for a given combination
of PLMN identity and UE radio configuration and any existing UE radio
capability ID shall be deleted when a new UE radio capability ID is
added for the same combination of PLMN identity and UE radio
configuration. If the UE receives a network-assigned UE radio capability
ID with a Version ID value different from the value included in the
network-assigned UE radio capability ID(s) stored at the UE for the
serving PLMN, the UE may delete these stored network-assigned UE radio
capability ID(s).

If the UE is attached for emergency bearer services, the UE shall not
store the EMM parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in
non-volatile memory. Instead the UE shall temporarily store these
parameters locally in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters
when the UE is detached from emergency services (e.g before attaching
for normal service.

If the UE is configured for eCall only mode as specified in
3GPP TS 31.102 [17], the UE shall not store the EMM parameters described
in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile memory. Instead the UE
shall temporarily store these parameters locally in the ME and the UE
shall delete these parameters when the UE enters
EMM-DEREGISTERED.eCALL-INACTIVE state, the UE is switched-off or the
USIM is removed.

If the UE is attached for access to RLOS, the UE shall not store the EMM
parameters described in this annex on the USIM or in non-volatile
memory. Instead, the UE shall temporarily store these parameters locally
in the ME and the UE shall delete these parameters after detach.

Annex D (normative): Establishment cause (S1 mode only)

D.1 Mapping of NAS procedure to RRC establishment cause (S1 mode only)

When EMM requests the establishment of a NAS-signalling connection, or
when EMM requests the lower layers to resume a NAS signalling
connection, the RRC establishment cause used by the UE shall be selected
according to the NAS procedure as specified in table D.1.1. The EMM
shall also indicate to the lower layer for the purpose of access
control, the call type associated with the RRC establishment cause as
specified in table D.1.1. If the UE is configured for EAB (see the
"ExtendedAccessBarring" leaf of NAS configuration MO in
3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]), the EMM shall indicate to
the lower layer for the purpose of access control that EAB applies for
this request except for the following cases:

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE is answering to paging;

- the RRC Establishment cause is set to "Emergency call";

- the UE is configured to allow overriding EAB (see the
"Override_ExtendedAccessBarring" leaf of the NAS configuration MO as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and receives
an indication from the upper layers to override EAB; or

- the UE is configured to allow overriding EAB (see the
"Override_ExtendedAccessBarring" leaf of the NAS configuration MO as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.368 [15A] or 3GPP TS 31.102 [17]) and already
has a PDN connection that was established with EAB override.

NOTE: The RRC establishment cause can be used by the network to
prioritise the connection establishment request from the UE at high load
situations in the network.

 Annex E (informative): Guidelines for enhancements to MS network capability IE and UE network capability IE

The UE uses the information elements MS network capability and UE
network capability to inform the core network about its network related
capabilities. Both information elements can be signalled in any of the
modes: A/Gb mode, Iu mode and S1 mode.

The purpose of the present annex is to give some guidelines how to
select the information element(s) to be enhanced if new capabilities
need to be added.

1) If a capability is related to a feature that can be used in a network
supporting A/Gb mode only or Iu mode only or both, the capability will
be signalled in the MS network capability IE.

2) If a capability is related to a feature that can be used in network
supporting S1 mode only, the capability will be signalled in the UE
network capability IE.

3) If a capability is related to a feature that can be used only in a
network supporting both S1 mode and at least one of the two modes A/Gb
mode and Iu mode, the capability is added only to one of the two
information elements:

a) If the information is used by the MME only, the capability will be
signalled in the UE network capability IE.

b) If the information is used by the SGSN only or both by the SGSN and
by the MME, the capability will be signalled in the MS network
capability IE.

NOTE: The reason for rules 1 and 2 is that a UE not supporting A/Gb mode
and Iu mode will not provide the MS network capability IE to the network
and a UE not supporting S1 mode will not provide the UE network
capability IE. In some cases, due to rules 1 and 2 the capability
indicator will be included in both information elements.

EXAMPLE 1: The support indicator for UCS2 is included in both
information elements.

EXAMPLE 2: The "SRVCC to GERAN/UTRAN capability" is included in the MS
network capability IE, as it is used both by the MME for SRVCC from
E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN and by the SGSN for SRVCC from UTRAN HSPA to
GERAN/UTRAN.

 Annex F (normative): Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication (ACDC)

The UE may support the procedures in this annex.

If the UE supports ACDC, the EMM layer shall determine the ACDC category
applicable to the request based on the application identifier received
from the upper layers and the configuration information in the
"ACDCConf" leaf of ACDC MO as specified in 3GPP TS 24.105 [35] or in the
USIM EF_(ACDC) as specified in 3GPP TS 31.102 [17].

NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the upper layers can determine the
ACDC category and send it to the EMM layer. Then the EMM layer need not
read the ACDC MO or USIM to determine the ACDC category.

The EMM sublayer shall indicate to the lower layers, for the purpose of
access control:

- the ACDC category that applies to this request if only one ACDC
category is applicable;

- the highest ranked ACDC category among the ACDC categories that
applies to this request if multiple ACDC categories are applicable; or

- this request is for an uncategorized application if an application
identifier received from the upper layers is not mapped to any ACDC
category,

except for the following cases:

- the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN;

- the UE is answering to paging;

- the RRC Establishment cause is set to "Emergency call"; or

- if conditions MO MMTEL voice call is started or MO MMTEL video call is
started or MO SMSoIP is started, is satisfied.

NOTE 2: The request from the EMM sublayer refers to either a request to
establish an initial NAS signalling connection or a request to
re-establish a NAS signalling connection.

If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM
layer shall keep track of the ACDC category for which access is barred
and it shall not send a request for the same ACDC category or a lower
ACDC category until access is granted.

If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM
layer shall not send a request for any uncategorized application until
access is granted.
