  The present document specifies the procedures used by the protocols for mobility management and session management between User Equipment (UE) and Mobility Management Entity (MME) in the Evolved Packet System (EPS). These protocols belong to the non-access stratum (NAS).  The EPS Mobility Management (EMM) protocol defined in the present document provides procedures for the control of mobility when the User Equipment (UE) is using the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN).
 The EMM protocol also provides control of security for the NAS protocols.  The EPS Session Management (ESM) protocol defined in the present document provides procedures for the handling of EPS bearer contexts. Together with the bearer control provided by the access stratum, this protocol is used for the control of user plane bearers.  For both NAS protocols the present document specifies procedures for the support of inter-system mobility between E‑UTRAN and other 3GPP or    For inter-system mobility between E-UTRAN and GERAN, UTRAN or NG-RAN,  by the NAS protocols defined in the present document and the NAS protocols specified in 3GPPTS208 for GERAN and UTRAN, and    For inter-system mobility between E-UTRAN and generic non-3GPP access networks, this includes specific NAS procedures to maintain IP connectivity to the PDN Gateway and to provide parameters needed by the UE when using mobility management based on Dual-Stack Mobile IPv6 (see   The present document is applicable to the UE and to the Mobility Management Entity (MME) in the EPS.  The present document is also applicable to the relay node in the EPS   The present document also specifies NAS signalling enhancement for the support of efficient transport of IP, non-IP, Ethernet and SMS data of

 For the definition of the S101 reference point, see 3GPPTS202.  SIPTO at the local network PDN connection: A PDN connection, for which the default EPS bearer context or default PDP context was activated with an APN authorized to use SIPTO at the local network and it was activated such that the traffic of the PDN connection will be using an L-GW.
 The network authorizes an APN for using SIPTO at the local network based on the subscription profile (see 3GPPTS272[16C]) and subsequently the  connection.
 SIPTO at the local network PDN connection can be of IP, non-IP or Ethernet PDN type.    function collocated with the (H)(e)NodeB.

  The non-access stratum (NAS) described in the present document forms the highest stratum of the control plane between UE and MME at the radio interface (reference point "LTE-Uu"; see 3GPPTS201).  Main functions of the protocols that are part of the NAS are:   the support of mobility of the user equipment (UE); and   the support of session management procedures to establish and maintain    NAS security is an additional function of the NAS providing services to the NAS protocols, e.
g.
 integrity protection and ciphering of NAS   For the support of the above functions, the following procedures are supplied within this specification:   elementary procedures for EPS mobility management in clause5; and   elementary procedures for EPS session management in clause  Complete NAS transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary procedures.
 Examples of such specific sequences can be found in   The NAS for EPS follows the protocol architecture model for layer3 as described in 3GPPTS207; however, due to the objective of EPS to provide the subscriber with a "ready-to-use" IP connectivity and an  management and session management procedures during the attach procedure   Signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are described as part of the EPS mobility management in clause In addition to that, principles for the handing of EPS security contexts and for the  connection is established, are provided in clause   Linkage between the protocols for EPS mobility management and EPS session management   bearer context (i.
e.
 if the UE requests PDN connectivity in the attach request).
 Additionally, the network can activate one or several dedicated EPS bearer contexts in parallel for PDN connections of IP or Ethernet PDN type.
 To this purpose the EPS session management messages for the default EPS bearer context activation can be transmitted in an information element in the EPS mobility management messages.
 In this case, the UE and the network execute the attach procedure, the default EPS bearer context activation procedure, and the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure in parallel.
 The UE and network shall complete the combined default EPS bearer context activation procedure and the attach procedure before the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure is completed.
 If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, then the success of the attach procedure is dependent on the success of the default EPS bearer context activation procedure.
 If the attach procedure fails, then the ESM procedures also fail.  A UE using EPS services with control plane CIoT EPS optimization can initiate transport of user data via the control plane.
 For this purpose a UE in EMM-IDLE mode can initiate the service request procedure and transmit the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message in an information element in the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message.  Except for the attach procedure and the service request procedure, during EMM procedures the MME shall suspend the transmission of ESM messages.
 During the service request procedure the MME may suspend the transmission of ESM messages.  Except for the attach procedure and the service request procedure for UE initiated transport of user data via the control plane, during EMM procedures the UE shall suspend the transmission of ESM messages.  A Handling of NAS signalling low priority indication  A UE configured for NAS signalling low priority (see 3GPPTS268[15A], 3GPPTS302) indicates this by including the Device properties IE in the appropriate NAS message and setting the low priority indicator to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", except for the following cases in which the UE shall set the low priority indicator to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low    the UE is performing an attach for emergency bearer services;   and is performing EPS mobility management procedures, or is establishing a PDN connection for emergency bearer services;   the UE configured for dual priority is requested by the upper layers  is not configured for NAS signalling low priority";   the UE configured for dual priority is performing EPS session management procedures related to the PDN connection established with low priority indicator set to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low    by setting the low priority indicator to "MS is not configured for NAS signalling low priority" and is performing EPS mobility management    emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call;     the UE is responding to paging.  The network may use the NAS signalling low priority indication for NAS level mobility management congestion control and APN based congestion    CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the MME stores the NAS signalling low priority indication within the default EPS bearer context activated due to the PDN connectivity request procedure.   UE mode of operation 
  A UE attached for EPS services shall operate in one of the following    PS mode 1 of operation: the UE registers only to EPS services, and UE's usage setting is "voice centric";   PS mode 2 of operation: the UE registers only to EPS services, and UE's usage setting is "data centric";   CS/PS mode 1 of operation: the UE registers to both EPS and non-EPS services, and UE's usage setting is "voice centric"; and   CS/PS mode 2 of operation: the UE registers to both EPS and non-EPS services, and UE's usage setting is "data centric".  A UE configured to use CS fallback, shall operate in CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode Such UE may also be configured to use IMS, in which case the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN as defined in 3GPPTS267[13B] shall be used for the selection of the domain for originating voice communication services.  NOTE1: The domain selected for originating voice communication services      unable to perform CS fallback, the UE shall attempt to select GERAN or  should disable the E-UTRA capability (see clause) to allow a potential callback, and then progress the CS emergency call    if the UE needs to initiate a 1xCS fallback emergency call but it is unable to perform 1xCS fallback, the UE shall attempt to select cdma2000® 1x radio access technology to establish the call.  NOTE2: Unable to perform CS fallback or 1xCS fallback means that either the UE was not allowed to attempt CS fallback or 1xCS fallback, or CS fallback or 1xCS fallback attempt failed.  A UE configured to use SMS over SGs shall operate in CS/PS mode 1 or   The behaviour of the UE in CS/PS mode 1 of operation, upon failure to access the CS domain or upon reception of a "CS fallback not preferred" or "SMS only" indication, will depend on the availability of voice over IMS.
 In the present document, "IMS voice not available" refers to one of   a) the UE is not configured to use IMS;  b) the UE is not configured to use IMS voice, i.
e.
 when the voice domain preference for E-UTRAN, as defined in 3GPPTS267[13B], indicates that voice communication services are allowed to be invoked only over   c) the UE is configured to use IMS voice, but the network indicates in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that IMS voice over PS sessions are not supported; or  d) the UE is configured to use IMS voice, the network indicates in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message that IMS voice over PS sessions are supported, but the upper layers:   provide no indication that the UE is available for voice call in the    indicate that the UE is not available for voice calls in the IMS.   need time to attempt IMS registration.
 In the event an indication from the upper layers that the UE is available for voice calls in the IMS takes longer than the manufacturer determined period of time (e.
g.
 due to delay when attempting IMS registration or due to delay obtaining an EPS bearer context for SIP signalling), the NAS layer assumes the UE is not available for voice calls in the IMS.  Other conditions may exist but these are implementation specific.  In the present document, "IMS voice available" refers to the conditions  voice not available" evaluate to false.   Change of UE mode of operation 
       a change of voice domain preference for E-UTRAN as defined in    a change in the UE's availability for voice calls in the IMS; or   a change in UE configuration regarding the use of SMS as defined in   Figure and figure illustrate the transitions between different UE mode of operations when UE's usage settings, voice domain preference for E-UTRAN or configuration regarding SMS changes.    NOTE1: The UE may transit from CS/PS mode 1 to PS mode 1 or from CS/PS mode 2 to PS mode 2 if "CS domain not available" is received.
 After the transition to PS mode 1 or PS mode 2 due to "CS domain not available", the UE can transit back to CS/PS mode 1 or CS/PS mode 2, e.
g.
 due to change of PLMN which is not in the list of the equivalent PLMNs.  NOTE2: Not all possible transitions are shown in this figure.

  This clause describes the principles for the handling of EPS security contexts in the UE and in the MME and the procedures used for the security protection of EPS NAS messages between UE and MME.
 Security protection involves integrity protection and ciphering of the EMM and   The signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are part of the EMM protocol and are described in detail in clause   clause, for the ease of description, it is assumed that ciphering is  without ciphering is achieved by configuring the MME so that it always selects the "null ciphering algorithm", EEA   Handling of EPS security contexts 
  The security parameters for authentication, integrity protection and ciphering are tied together in an EPS security context and identified by a key set identifier for E-UTRAN (eKSI).
 The relationship between the security parameters is defined in 3GPPTS301.  Before security can be activated, the MME and the UE need to establish an EPS security context.
 Usually, the EPS security context is created as the result of an EPS authentication procedure between MME and UE.
   during inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode  a UMTS security context that has been established while the UE was in A/Gb mode or Iu mode; or   during CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu   was in A/Gb mode or Iu mode.  The EPS security context is taken into use by the UE and the MME, when  inter-system handover procedure from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or Iu mode to S1 mode.
 The EPS security context which has been taken into use by the network most recently is called current EPS security context.
 This current EPS security context can be of type native or mapped, i.
e.    The key set identifier eKSI is assigned by the MME either during the EPS authentication procedure or, for the mapped EPS security context, during  type of security context parameter indicating whether an EPS security   the eKSI has the value of KSI_(ASME), and when the current EPS security context is of type mapped, the eKSI has the value of KSI_(SGSN).  The EPS security context which is indicated by an eKSI can be taken into   authentication procedure (see clause) or when the MME initiates a security mode control procedure.
 For this purpose the initial NAS messages (i.
e.
 ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, DETACH REQUEST, SERVICE REQUEST, EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST, and CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST) and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contain an eKSI in the NAS key set identifier IE or the value part of eKSI in the KSI and sequence number IE indicating the current EPS security context used to integrity protect the NAS message.  In the present document, when the UE is required to delete an eKSI, the UE shall set the eKSI to the value "no key is available" and consider also the associated keys K_(ASME) or K'_(ASME), EPS NAS ciphering key and EPS NAS integrity key invalid (i.
e.
 the EPS security context associated with the eKSI as no longer valid).  NOTE: In some specifications the term ciphering key sequence number might be used instead of the term Key Set Identifier (KSI).  The UE and the MME need to be able to maintain two EPS security contexts  EPS security context, since:   after an EPS re-authentication, the UE and the MME can have both a  which has not yet been taken into use (i.

When the MME and the UE create an EPS security context using null integrity and null ciphering algorithm during an attach procedure for   clause), the MME and the UE shall delete the previous current EPS security context.

g.

When the UE or the MME moves from EMM-REGISTERED to EMM-DEREGISTERED   the non-current EPS security context shall become the current EPS security context.
 Furthermore, the UE and the MME shall delete any mapped EPS security context or partial native EPS security context.  The UE shall mark the EPS security context on the USIM or in the non-volatile memory as invalid when the UE initiates an attach procedure as described in clause or when the UE leaves state EMM-DEREGISTERED for any other state except EMM-NULL.  The UE shall store the current native EPS security context as specified in annexC and mark it as valid only when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED from any other state except EMM-NULL or when the UE aborts the attach procedure without having left EMM-DEREGISTERED.     inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode in  nonce_(MME) and generate the K'_(ASME) using the created nonce_(MME) as indicated in 3GPPTS301.

 The MME shall derive the EPS NAS keys from K'_(ASME).  When the UE receives the command to perform handover to E-UTRAN, the UE shall derive K'_(ASME,) as indicated in 3GPPTS301, using the nonce_(MME) received in the NAS security transparent container. Furthermore, the UE shall associate the derived K'_(ASME) with the received KSI_(SGSN) and derive the EPS NAS keys from K'_(ASME).   no current UMTS security context, the MME shall set EIA0 and EEA0 as the selected NAS security algorithms in the NAS security transparent  generated K'_(ASME).

At change from A/Gb mode to S1 mode due to CS to PS SRVCC handover, ciphering may be started and integrity protection shall be started (see 3GPPTS331) without any new authentication procedure.

 The MME shall include the selected NAS algorithms, NONCE_(MME) and generated transparent container for the handover to E-UTRAN.
 The MME shall derive the EPS NAS keys from K'_(ASME).  When the UE receives the command to perform CS to PS SRVCC handover to S1 mode, the ME shall generate the CK'_(PS) and IK'_(PS) using the CS UMTS integrity key, the CS UMTS ciphering key and the received NONCE_(MSC) value in the transparent container in the CS to PS SRVCC handover command as specified in annexB.

 The ME shall ignore the NONCE_(MME) value received in the NAS Security Transparent Container in the CS to PS SRVCC handover command.  NOTE3: The NONCE_(MME) value received in the NAS Security Transparent Container for the handover to E-UTRAN is not used by the ME or MME in any key derivation in this handover.  The ME shall create the key K'_(ASME) by concatenating the derived  the KSI_(SGSN) associated to K'_(ASME) to the KSI_(SGSN) value received in the NAS Security Transparent Container from the network.  NOTE4: Although this case is related to the MSC server enhanced for    The ME shall derive the EPS NAS keys (CK' and IK') from the K'_(ASME) as specified in 3GPPTS301.
 The ME shall apply these derived EPS NAS security keys (CK' and IK'), reset the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values for the mapped EPS security context (i.
e.
 to the value 0), and replace an already established mapped EPS security context for the PS domain, if any, in the ME, when the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has been completed successfully.
 If the already established current EPS security context is of type native, then it shall become the non-current native EPS security context and overwrite any existing non-current native EPS security context in the ME.  The network shall replace an already established mapped EPS security context for the PS domain, if any, when the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has been completed successfully.
 If the already established current EPS security context is of type native, then it shall become the non-current native EPS security context and overwrite any existing non-current native EPS security context in the MME.  If the CS to PS SRVCC handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode has not been completed successfully, the UE and the network shall delete the new derived mapped EPS security context for the PS domain.
 Additionally, the network shall delete an already established mapped EPS security context for the PS domain, if any, if the eKSI of the already established EPS security context is equal to the KSI_(SGSN) of the new derived EPS security context for the PS domain.   Handling of NAS COUNT and NAS sequence number 
  Each EPS security context shall be associated with two separate counters NAS COUNT: one related to uplink NAS messages and one related to downlink NAS messages.
 The NAS COUNT counters use 24 bit internal representation and are independently maintained by UE and MME.
 The NAS     When NAS COUNT is input to NAS ciphering or NAS integrity algorithms it shall be considered to be a 3bit entity which shall be constructed by padding the 2bit internal representation with 8 zeros in the most   The value of the uplink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or non-volatile memory as described in annexC, is the value that shall be used in the next NAS message.  The value of the downlink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or non-volatile memory as described in annexC, is the largest   The value of the uplink NAS COUNT stored in the MME is the largest   The value of the downlink NAS COUNT stored in the MME is the value that shall be used in the next NAS message.  The NAS sequence number part of the NAS COUNT shall be exchanged between the UE and the MME as part of the NAS signalling.
 After each new or retransmitted outbound security protected NAS message, the sender shall increase the NAS COUNT number by one, except for the initial NAS messages if the lower layers indicated the failure to establish the RRC connection (see 3GPPTS331).
 Specifically, on the sender side, the NAS sequence number shall be increased by one, and if the result is zero (due to wrap around), the NAS overflow counter shall also be incremented by one (see clause).
 The receiving side shall estimate the NAS COUNT used by the sending side.
 Specifically, if the estimated NAS sequence number wraps around, the NAS overflow counter shall be incremented by one.       S1mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode in idle mode as specified in 3GPPTS208, the UE shall increase the uplink NAS COUNT by one.   inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode, the MME shall check the NAS token as specified in 3GPPTS301, clause, and update its uplink NAS COUNT with the uplink NAS COUNT value used for the successful check of the NAS token.  NOTE1: The MME does not check the NAS token if it is received via SGSN     security context is derived and taken into use, the MME shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this EPS security context to zero.
 The UE shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT    3GPPTS301 and taken into use in the following cases:   during the inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in    during the inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE    the MME shall store the mapped EPS NAS security context with the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters associated with the derived K'_(ASME) key set to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of the mapped EPS NAS security context respectively.
 The UE shall set the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of the current 5G NAS security context respectively.  During the handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN/GERAN the MME signals the    During handover to or from E-UTRAN, the MME shall increment downlink NAS    NOTE2: During the handover from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, the NAS security transparent container (see clause) is treated as an implicit SECURITY MODE COMMAND message for the UE and the MME, and therefore the MME regards the sending of the NAS security transparent container as the sending of an initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message in  purpose of the NAS COUNT handling.  In some NAS messages only 5 of the 8 NAS sequence number bits are transmitted.
 When this is the case, the receiver shall estimate the remaining 3 most significant bits of the sequence number.    Replay protection shall be supported for received NAS messages both in the MME and the UE.
 However, since the realization of replay protection does not affect the interoperability between nodes, no specific mechanism is required for implementation.  Replay protection must assure that one and the same NAS message is not   only if message integrity verifies correctly.  Replay protection is not applicable when EIA0 is used.

 The integrity protection of the SERVICE REQUEST message is defined in clause In addition to the data that is to be integrity protected, the constant BEARER ID, DIRECTION bit, NAS COUNT and NAS integrity key are input to the integrity protection algorithm.
 These parameters are described in   After successful integrity protection validation, the receiver shall update its corresponding locally stored NAS COUNT with the value of the estimated NAS COUNT for this NAS message.  Integrity verification is not applicable when EIA0 is used.    The sender shall use its locally stored NAS COUNT as input to the   The receiver shall use the NAS sequence number included in the received message (or estimated from the 5 bits of the NAS sequence number received in the message) and an estimate for the NAS overflow counter as defined in clause to form the NAS COUNT input to the deciphering   The input parameters to the NAS ciphering algorithm are the constant BEARER ID, DIRECTION bit, NAS COUNT, NAS encryption key and the length of the key stream to be generated by the encryption algorithm.
 When an initial plain NAS message for transport of user data via control plane (i.
e.
 CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message) is to be partially ciphered, the length of the key stream is set to the length of the part of the initial plain NAS message (i.
e.

 Prior to sending the next uplink NAS message, the UE shall delete the eKSI indicating the current EPS security context.  When the EIA0 is used as the NAS integrity algorithm, the UE and the MME shall allow NAS COUNT wrap around.
 If NAS COUNT wrap around occurs, the    the UE and the MME shall continue to use the current security context;   the MME shall not initiate the EPS AKA procedure;   the MME shall not release the NAS signalling connection; and      Integrity protection of NAS signalling messages 
  For the UE, integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the NAS  into use.
 For the network, integrity protected signalling is mandatory  established for the NAS signalling connection.
 Integrity protection of all NAS signalling messages is the responsibility of the NAS.
 It is the network which activates integrity protection.  The use of "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 (see clause3) in the current security context is only allowed for an unauthenticated UE for which establishment of emergency bearer services or access to RLOS is allowed.
 For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages, the UE and the MME shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether the "null integrity protection algorithm" or any other integrity protection algorithm is indicated in the security   If the "null integrity protection algorithm" EIA0 has been selected as an integrity protection algorithm, the receiver shall regard the NAS messages with the security header indicating integrity protection as   Details of the integrity protection and verification of NAS signalling messages are specified in 3GPPTS301.   protected, the NAS message is first ciphered and then the ciphered NAS message and the NAS sequence number are integrity protected by calculating the MAC.
 The same applies when an initial NAS message needs to be sent partially ciphered and integrity protected.  NOTE: NAS messages that are ciphered or partially ciphered with the "null ciphering algorithm" EEA0 are regarded as ciphered or partially ciphered, respectively (see clause).   unciphered, the unciphered NAS message and the NAS sequence number are integrity protected by calculating the MAC.  When during the EPS attach procedure or service request procedure an ESM message is piggybacked in an EMM message, there is only one sequence number IE and one message authentication code IE, if any, for the    Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the UE  Except the messages listed below, no NAS signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving EMM entity in the UE or forwarded to the ESM entity, unless the network has established secure exchange of NAS messages for the NAS signalling connection:     IDENTITY REQUEST (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);       ATTACH REJECT (if the EMM cause is not #25 or #78);   DETACH ACCEPT (for non switch off);   TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT (if the EMM cause is not #25 or #78);   SERVICE REJECT (if the EMM cause is not #25 or #78).  NOTE: These messages are accepted by the UE without integrity protection, as in certain situations they are sent by the network before security can be activated.  All ESM messages are integrity protected.  Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established, the receiving EMM or ESM entity in the UE shall not process any NAS signalling messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the NAS.
 If NAS signalling messages, having not successfully passed the integrity check, are received, then the NAS in the UE shall discard that message.
 The processing of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that has not successfully passed the integrity check is specified in clause If any NAS signalling message is received as not integrity protected even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established by the network, then the NAS shall discard this    Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the MME  Except the messages listed below, no NAS signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving EMM entity in the MME or forwarded to the ESM entity, unless the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection:       IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);             TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST.  NOTE1: The TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is sent by the UE without integrity protection, if the tracking area updating procedure is initiated due to an inter-system change in idle mode and no current EPS security context is available in the UE.
 The other messages are accepted by the MME without integrity protection, as in certain situations they are sent by the UE before security can be activated.  NOTE2: The DETACH REQUEST message can be sent by the UE without integrity protection, e.
g.
 if the UE is attached for emergency bearer services or access to RLOS and there is no shared EPS security context available, or if due to user interaction an attach procedure is cancelled before the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established.
 For these cases the network can attempt to use additional criteria (e.
g.
 whether the UE is subsequently still performing periodic tracking area updating or still responding to paging) before marking the    REQUEST message if it is sent piggybacked in ATTACH REQUEST message and NAS security is not activated.   NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection, the receiving EMM entity in the MME shall process the following NAS signalling messages, even if the MAC included in the message fails the integrity check or cannot be verified, as the EPS security context is not available in the network:     IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is IMSI);             TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST;       CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST.  NOTE3: These messages are processed by the MME even when the MAC that fails the integrity check or cannot be verified, as in certain situations they can be sent by the UE protected with an EPS security context that is no longer available in the network.  If an ATTACH REQUEST message is received without integrity protection or fails the integrity check and it is not an attach request for emergency bearer services and it is not an attach request for access to RLOS, the MME shall authenticate the subscriber before processing the attach   MODE COMMAND message as specified in clause If authentication procedure is not successful the MME shall maintain, if any, the EMM-context and EPS security context unchanged.
 For the case when the attach procedure is for emergency bearer services see clause       initiate an authentication procedure, the MME should authenticate the subscriber before processing the detach request any further.   initiate an authentication procedure for any other reason, the MME may ignore the detach request and remain in state EMM-REGISTERED.  NOTE4: The network can attempt to use additional criteria (e.
g.
 whether the UE is subsequently still performing periodic tracking area updating or still responding to paging) before marking the UE as    protection or fails the integrity check and the UE provided a nonce_(UE), GPRS ciphering key sequence number, P-TMSI and RAI in the    bearer services established and the PDN connection is not for RLOS, the MME shall initiate an authentication procedure.

 For the  RLOS and integrity check fails, the MME may skip the authentication procedure even if no EPS security context is available and proceed directly to the execution of the security mode control procedure as specified in clause After successful completion of the service request procedure, the network shall deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers locally which are not EPS bearers for RLOS.
 The emergency EPS bearers shall not be deactivated.

 If any NAS signalling message, having not successfully passed the integrity check, is received, then the NAS in the MME shall discard that message.
 If any NAS signalling message is received, as not integrity protected even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established, then the NAS shall discard this message.   Ciphering of NAS signalling messages   configuration.
 When operation of the network without ciphering is configured, the MME shall indicate the use of "null ciphering algorithm" EEA0 (see clause3) in the current security context for all UEs. For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages, the UE and the MME shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether the "null ciphering algorithm" or any other ciphering algorithm is indicated in    the initial NAS message    container information element; and   unciphered, if it is any other initial NAS message.  The UE shall partially cipher the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message by ciphering the value part of the ESM message container IE or the value part of the NAS message container, using the ciphering algorithm of the current EPS security context.  The UE shall send the ATTACH REQUEST message always unciphered.  The UE shall send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message always   Except for the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message including an ESM  information element, the UE shall start the ciphering and deciphering of NAS messages when the secure exchange of NAS messages has been  unless explicitly defined, the UE shall send all NAS messages ciphered until the NAS signalling connection is released, or the UE performs intersystem handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.  The MME shall start ciphering and deciphering of NAS messages as described in clause From this time onward, except for the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the MME shall send all NAS messages ciphered until the NAS signalling connection is released, or the UE performs intersystem handover to A/Gb mode or Iu mode.  Once the encryption of NAS messages has been started between the MME and the UE, the receiver shall discard the unciphered NAS messages which shall have been ciphered according to the rules described in this specification.
 The MME shall discard any CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST  message container information element which has not been partially ciphered according to the rules described above.   algorithm, the NAS messages with the security header indicating ciphering are regarded as ciphered.  Details of ciphering and deciphering of NAS signalling messages are    Disabling and re-enabling of UE's E-UTRA capability  The UE shall only disable the E-UTRA capability when in EMM-IDLE mode.  When the UE supports both N1 mode and S1 mode then the UE's capability to access the 5GCN via E-UTRA shall not be affected, if the UE's E-UTRA capability is disabled or enabled.  When the UE is disabling the E-UTRA capability not due to redirection to 5GCN required, it should proceed as follows:  a) select another RAT (GERAN, UTRAN, or NG-RAN if the UE has not disabled its N1 mode capability for 3GPP access as specified in      PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPPTS222.
 As an implementation option, instead of performing PLMN selection, the UE may select another RAT of the chosen PLMN.
 If disabling of E-UTRA capability was not due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services only, the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability for this PLMN   c) if no other allowed PLMN and RAT combinations are available, then the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability and remain registered for EPS services in E-UTRAN of the registered PLMN.
 If the UE chooses this option, then it may periodically attempt to select another PLMN and RAT combination that can provide non-EPS services.
 How this periodic scanning is done, is UE implementation dependent.

LIMITED-SERVICE the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability for 3GPP access at expiry of the implementation-specific timer, if the timer had been started, and may then, proceed with the appropriate EMM procedure.  ii) If the UE is in WB-S1 mode:  1) if lower layers do not provide an indication that the current E-UTRA cell is connected to 5GCN or lower layers do not provide an indication that the current E-UTRA cell supports CIoT 5GS optimizations that are    2) if lower layers provide an indication that the current E-UTRA cell is connected to 5GCN and the current E-UTRA cell supports CIoT 5GS  selection to select 5GCN as specified in 3GPPTS201    or there is no suitable E-UTRA cell connected to 5GCN which supports CIoT 5GS optimizations that are supported by the UE, the UE, as an implementation option, may indicate to lower layers to remain camped in E-UTRA cell connected to EPC, may then start an implementation-specific timer and enter the state EMM-REGISTERED.
LIMITED-SERVICE the UE may re-enable the E-UTRA capability for 3GPP access at expiry of the implementation-specific timer, if the timer had been started, and may then, proceed with the appropriate EMM procedure.      the disabling of E-UTRA capability was due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services only; or   the UE has already re-enabled the E-UTRA capability when performing bullets b) or c) above.    the UE for which E-UTRA capability was disabled, and the disabling of E-UTRA capability was not due to UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services only, the UE shall re-enable the E-UTRA capability after the RR/RRC connection is released.  If UE that has disabled its E-UTRA capability due to IMS voice not available and CS fallback not available re-enables it when PLMN selection is performed, then it should memorize the identity of the PLMNs where E-UTRA capability was disabled and use that stored information in subsequent PLMN selections as specified in   The UE may support "E-UTRA Disabling for EMM cause #15" and implement    if the "E-UTRA Disabling Allowed for EMM cause #15" parameter as specified in 3GPPTS268[15A] or 3GPPTS302 is present and set to enabled; and   if the UE receives an ATTACH REJECT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message including both EMM cause #15 "no suitable cells in tracking area" and an Extended EMM cause IE with value "E-UTRAN not allowed";  then the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability, memorize the identity of the PLMN where the E-UTRA capability was disabled and use that stored information in subsequent PLMN selections as specified in   When the UE supporting the A/Gb and/or Iu mode together with the S1 mode needs to stay in A/Gb or Iu mode, in order to prevent unwanted handover or cell reselection from UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN, the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability and:   The UE shall not set the E-UTRA support bits of the MS Radio Access capability IE (see 3GPPTS208, clause12a), the E-UTRA support bits of Mobile Station Classmark 3 IE (see 3GPPTS208, clause1), the PS inter-RAT HO from GERAN to E-UTRAN S1 mode capability bit and the ISR support bit of the MS network capability IE (see 3GPPTS208, clause12) in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message after it selects    the UE shall use the same value of the EPC capability bit of the MS network capability IE (see 3GPPTS208, clause12) in the ATTACH REQUEST message and the ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message; and   the UE NAS layer shall indicate the access stratum layer(s) of disabling of the E-UTRA capability.  When the UE supporting N1 mode together with S1 mode needs to stay in N1 mode, in order to prevent unwanted handover or cell reselection from NG-RAN to E-UTRAN, the UE shall disable the E-UTRA capability and:   the UE shall set the S1 mode bit to "S1 mode not supported" in the 5GMM Capability IE of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message (see    the UE shall not include the S1 UE network capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message (see 3GPPTS201); and   the UE NAS layer shall indicate the access stratum layer(s) of disabling of the E-UTRA capability.

If the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the attempt to select GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology progressing the CS emergency call establishment (see clause), the criteria to enable the E-UTRA capability again is UE implementation specific.  If the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to the UE initiated detach procedure for EPS services only (see clause), upon request of the upper layers to re-attach for EPS services the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability again.
 If the E-UTRA capability was disabled due to receipt of EMM cause #14 "EPS services not allowed in this PLMN", then the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability when the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed.
 If E-UTRA capability was disabled for any other reason, the UE shall enable the E-UTRA capability in the following cases:   the UE mode of operation changes from CS/PS mode 1 of operation to CS/PS mode 2 of operation;   the UE mode of operation changes from PS mode 1 of operation to PS mode 2 of operation; or   the UE powers off and powers on again or the USIM is removed;   E-UTRA when the UE's attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter reaches5 and the UE disables E-UTRA capability for cases described in clauses, , , ,  and The UE should memorize the identity of the PLMNs where E-UTRA capability was disabled.
 On expiry of this timer:   if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and is in idle mode as specified in 3GPPTS208, the UE should enable the E-UTRA capability;   if the UE is in Iu mode or A/Gb mode and an RR connection exists, the UE shall delay enabling E-UTRA capability until the RR connection is    RR connection exists, the UE may abort the PS signalling connection before enabling E-UTRA capability; or   if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-IDLE mode as specified in 3GPPTS201, the UE should enable the E-UTRA capability; and   if the UE is in N1 mode and is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode as specified in 3GPPTS201, the UE shall delay enabling the E-UTRA capability until the N1 NAS signalling connection is released.  When the UE enables E-UTRA capability, the UE shall delete the PLMN from the memorized identity of the PLMNs where E-UTRA capability was   NOTE1: As described 3GPPTS222, if the UE is in automatic PLMN selection mode, the UE does not consider the memorized PLMNs as PLMN selection candidates for E-UTRA access technology till the timer   If the UE attempts to establish an emergency bearer service or to access  attach attempt counter or tracking area updating attempt counter have reached5, the UE may enable the E-UTRA capability for that PLMN memorized by the UE.

NOTE: When using satellite E-UTRAN access, the restriction on use of enhanced coverage indication from the network is not considered when applicable NAS timers are determined.   Disabling and re-enabling of UE's NB-IoT capability  If the UE supports disabling and re-enabling of UE's NB-IoT capability and the UE in NB-S1 mode is disabling the NB-IoT capability, it should   a) select E-UTRAN, or for the UE which supports CIoT EPS optimization select satellite E-UTRAN via "WB-E-UTRAN(LEO)", "WB-E-UTRAN(MEO)", or    b) if E-UTRAN, or for the UE which supports CIoT EPS optimization if satellite E-UTRAN via "WB-E-UTRAN(LEO)", "WB-E-UTRAN(MEO)", or  equivalent PLMNs cannot be found, select another RAT (GERAN, UTRAN, or NG-RAN if the UE has not disabled its N1 mode capability for 3GPP access  from the list of equivalent PLMNs;    PLMN, then perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPPTS222.

The main function of the mobility management sublayer is to support the  present location and providing user identity confidentiality.  A further function of the mobility management sublayer is to provide connection management services to the session management (SM) sublayer and the short message services (SMS) entity of the connection management   All the EMM procedures described in this clause can only be performed if a NAS signalling connection has been established between the UE and the network.

 In this request to the lower layer the NAS shall provide to the lower layer the RRC establishment cause and the call type according to annexD of   NOTE1: In NB-S1 mode, in the request to the lower layer the data volume information of the initial NAS message is provided to the lower layers. Interactions between the NAS and the lower layers in order to obtain the data volume information of the initial NAS message (see 3GPPTS321, 3GPPTS331) is left to implementations.   Upon indication from the lower layers that the RRC connection has been resumed when in EMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication, the UE shall enter EMM-CONNECTED mode.
 If the pending NAS message is:  i) a SERVICE REQUEST message;  ii) a CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, and the UE did not include any ESM message container, NAS message container, EPS bearer context status information element, or UE request type information element; or  iii) an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message, and the Service type information element indicates "packet services via S1" and the UE did not include any EPS bearer context status information element, or UE request type information element;  the message shall not be sent.
 Otherwise the UE shall cipher the message as specified in clause and send the pending initial NAS message upon entering EMM-CONNECTED mode;   uplink NAS COUNT value corresponding to that message is reused for the next uplink NAS message to be sent.

 The maximum number of possible entries in the stored list is 1   Handling of the periodic tracking area update timer and mobile reachable timer (S1 mode only)  The periodic tracking area updating procedure is used to periodically notify the availability of the UE to the network.
 The procedure is controlled in the UE by timer T341 The value of timer T3412 is sent by the network to the UE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and can be sent in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.
 The UE shall apply this value in all tracking areas of the list of tracking areas assigned to the UE   If timer T3412 received by the UE in an ATTACH ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message contains an indication that the timer is deactivated or the timer value is zero, then timer T3412 is deactivated and the UE shall not perform the periodic tracking area updating   Timer T3412 is reset and started with its initial value, when the UE changes from EMM-CONNECTED to EMM-IDLE mode.

Handling of timer T3402  The value of timer T3402 can be sent by the network to the UE in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message.
 If the value is different from "deactivated", the UE shall apply this value in all tracking areas of the list of tracking areas assigned to the UE,   The value of timer T3402 can be sent by the network to the UE in the ATTACH REJECT message.
 If an ATTACH REJECT message including timer T3402 value different from "deactivated", was received integrity protected,   value of this timer is used.  The default value of this timer is also used by the UE in the following    ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is  TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message is not set to "periodic updating";   the network indicates that the timer is "deactivated";     a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs has been entered, the tracking area updating fails and the tracking area updating attempt counter is equal to 5; or   a new PLMN which is not in the list of equivalent PLMNs has been entered, the attach procedure fails, the attach attempt counter is equal to 5 and no ATTACH REJECT message was received from the new PLMN.   Handling of the Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List  The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers list contain additional local emergency numbers used by the serving network.
 These lists can be downloaded by the network to the UE at successful registration and subsequent registration updates.
 There is only one Local Emergency Numbers List and only one Extended Local Emergency Numbers list in the UE.
 The Local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode, with GMM and MM procedures if the UE is in A/Gb or Iu mode, and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in 3GPPTS201, if UE is in N1 mode.
 The Extended Local Emergency Numbers List can be updated with EMM procedures if the UE is in S1 mode and with 5GMM procedures, as specified in 3GPPTS201, if UE is in N1 mode.  The UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List and the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List received from the network in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM or user equipment to detect that the number dialled is an emergency number.  If the UE determines that the number dialled is an emergency number, the procedures specified in 3GPPTS267 and 3GPPTS229[13D] are   If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the PS domain, then the UE shall perform the session establishment procedures specified in 3GPPTS229[13D] to initiate an emergency session.  If the domain selected for the emergency session attempt is the CS domain (e.
g.
 the UE has selected GERAN or UTRAN radio access technology), then the UE shall use the stored Local Emergency Numbers List, in addition to the emergency numbers stored on the USIM and the ME, to determine if:   the UE is to send an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message:  1) for CS fallback, indicating "mobile originating CS fallback or 1xCS   2) for CS fallback for emergency call, indicating "mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call"; and   the call control entity of the UE specified in 3GPP TS208 is   NOTE1: The checking of whether the dialled number is an emergency number and the determination of whether an emergency call is to be  Local Emergency Numbers List does not apply when the CS domain is   NOTE2: The user equipment can use the emergency numbers in each of the stored lists to assist the end user in determining whether the dialled number is intended for an emergency service or for another destination, e.

If no Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, and the registered PLMN has not changed, then the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment shall be kept.
 If no Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is contained in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message, but the registered PLMN has changed, then:   if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates "Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received", the stored Extended Local Emergency Numbers List in the user equipment shall    if the last received indication in the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE indicates "Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid in the country of the PLMN from which this IE is received" the list shall be kept except if the user equipment has successfully    NOTE: To prevent the misrouting of emergency calls, all operators within a country need to follow the regulation or agree on the setting of the Extended emergency number list IE in accordance to national agreement –  only within the PLMN.  The Local Emergency Numbers List and the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List shall be deleted at switch off and removal of the USIM.
 The user equipment shall be able to store up to ten entries in the Local Emergency Numbers List and up to twenty entries in the Extended Local Emergency Numbers List, received from the network.  a Specific requirements for UE configured to use timer T3245  The following requirement applies for an UE that is configured to use    "forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode" list, or the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list or sets the USIM as invalid for non-EPS services or EPS services or both, and timer T3245 (see 3GPPTS208) is not running, the UE shall start timer T3245 as specified in   Upon expiry of the timer T3245, the UE shall erase the "forbidden PLMN list", the "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list, and the "forbidden PLMNs for attach in S101 mode" list and set the USIM to valid for non-EPS and EPS services.

 NAS level mobility management congestion control consists of general NAS level mobility management congestion control and subscribed APN based congestion control.  Under general overload conditions the network may reject mobility management signalling requests from UEs as specified in 3GPPTS201.
 The network should not reject the following    requests for emergency bearer services;     service request or tracking area update request triggered by paging;   requests from UEs that were received via NAS signalling connections established with RRC establishment cause "High priority access AC 11 –    requests for attach, normal tracking area updating or periodic tracking area updating, when emergency is indicated by lower layers;   requests for CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency    requests for tracking area update when the UE is reporting unavailability information due to enhanced discontinuous coverage.  When subscribed APN based mobility management congestion control is    In mobility management the network may detect NAS signalling congestion and start or stop performing the subscribed APN based congestion control based on mobility management level criteria such as:       setting in network management.  When the NAS level mobility management congestion control is active, the  T3346 in the reject messages.
 The UE starts the timer T3346 with the value received in the mobility management reject messages.
 To avoid that large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the network should select the value for the timer T3346 for the rejected UEs so that timeouts are not synchronised.  For subscribed APN based congestion control the value of timer T3346 for a particular APN may be APN dependent.  If the timer T3346 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3346 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.  If the UE is switched off when the timer T3346 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE    let t1 be the time remaining for T3346 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on.
 If t1 is greater thant, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t.
 If t1   with the value t1; and   message (ATTACH REQUEST, TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST, CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST or EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST) which contained the low priority indicator set to "MS is configured for NAS signalling low priority", then if timer T3346 is restarted at switch on, the UE configured for dual priority shall handle mobility management requests as indicated in clauses, and   PLMN is not equivalent to the PLMN where the UE started timer T3346, the UE shall stop timer T3346 when initiating mobility management procedures in the new PLMN.  After change in TAI which is not part of TAI list, if the timer T3346 is running and EMM update status is EU1 UPDATED then UE shall set the EMM update status to EU2 NOT UPDATED and enter state   A Handling of congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane  The network may activate congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, as specified in 3GPPTS201.  If the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane is active and if the UE has indicated support for the control  control plane data back-off timer T3448 in ATTACH ACCEPT, TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT, SERVICE ACCEPT or SERVICE REJECT message, and shall store  timer T3448 with the value informed in the message.
 To avoid that large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the network should select the value for the timer T3448 for the informed UEs so that timeouts are not synchronised.  The network sends TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or SERVICE ACCEPT message without T3448 value IE to stop the timer T3448 running in the UE as specified in clause and clause  Based on the stored control plane data back-off time for the UE, the network may reject the transfer of user data via the control plane initiated by the UE.  While the timer T3448 is running, the UE in EMM-IDLE mode shall not initiate the transport of user data via the control plane procedure (see clause), except if the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPPTS268[15A] or the USIM file EF_(NASCONFIG) in 3GPPTS302) and the user data is related to an exceptional    equivalent to the PLMN where the UE started the timer T3448, or upon being switched off while the timer T3448 is running, the UE shall stop the timer T344 For further criteria to stop of timer T3448, refer to   0 Access class control  The network can restrict the access for certain groups of UEs by means of barring their access class.  The UE shall evaluate the access control information as specified in  
   Access Control for CSFB and Extended Access Barring (EAB);   Access Control for Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication (ACDC), if the UE supports ACDC; and 
  1 Power saving mode  The UE can request the use of power saving mode (PSM) during an attach or tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPPTS282[11A] and 3GPPTS201).
 The UE shall not request the use of PSM during:   an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;   bearer services with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach";      established for emergency bearer services; or   an attach for access to RLOS.   timer T3324 when accepting the attach or tracking area updating procedure.
 The UE may use PSM only if the network has provided the T3324 value IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure with a value different from "deactivated".  NOTE: Timer T3324 is specified in 3GPPTS208.  Upon expiry of the timer T3324 or if the T3324 value provided by the network is zero, the UE may deactivate the AS layer and activate PSM by entering the state EMM-REGISTERED.
NO-CELL-AVAILABLE if:  a) the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services;  b) the UE has no PDN connection for emergency bearer services;  c) the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode;  d) in the EMM-REGISTERED.
NORMAL-SERVICE state; and  e) the UE is not attached for access to RLOS.   other than EMM-REGISTERED.
NORMAL-SERVICE when timer T3324 expires, the UE may activate PSM when the MS returns to state    from "deactivated" and the timer T3324 has expired, may activate PSM if it receives an "Extended wait time" from lower layers.  When PSM is activated all NAS timers are stopped and associated   EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) or higher prioritized PLMNs (see    connection for emergency bearer services, the UE shall not activate PSM.  If the UE is attached for access to RLOS, the UE shall not activate PSM.  The UE may deactivate PSM and activate the AS layer at any time.
 Upon deactivating PSM, the UE may initiate EMM procedures (e.
g.
 for the transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data).  2 Extended idle-mode DRX cycle  The UE may request the use of extended idle-mode DRX cycle (eDRX) during an attach or tracking area updating procedure by including the extended DRX parameters IE (see 3GPPTS282[11A] and 3GPPTS201). The UE shall not request the use of eDRX during:   an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;   a tracking area updating procedure for the UE attached for emergency    an attach for access to RLOS.      The network accepts the request to use the eDRX by providing the extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the attach or the tracking area updating procedure.
 The UE shall use eDRX only if it received the extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or tracking area    NOTE: If the UE wants to keep using eDRX, the UE includes the extended DRX parameters IE in each attach or tracking area updating procedure.  If the UE received the extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure, upon successful completion of the PDN disconnect procedure of the PDN connection for emergency bearer services or EPS bearer context deactivation procedure of the EPS bearer context for emergency, the UE shall resume eDRX.  If the network has provided the extended DRX parameters IE during the last attach or tracking area updating procedure, upon successful completion of the PDN disconnect procedure of the PDN connection for emergency bearer services or EPS bearer context deactivation procedure of the EPS bearer context for emergency, the network shall resume eDRX.  If the UE or the network locally releases the PDN connection for emergency bearer service, the UE or the network shall not use eDRX until  procedure with EPS bearer context synchronization or upon successful   If the UE did not receive the extended eDRX parameters IE, or if the UE  stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available.  If the network did not accept the request to use eDRX, or if the UE has a PDN connection for emergency bearer services, the network shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available.  If the network provided the extended DRX parameters IE and also assigned a new GUTI for the UE as described in clause during the last tracking area updating procedure, the network shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available, with the old GUTI and use the eDRX provided by the network with the new GUTI until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network (see clause).  3 Interaction between power saving mode and extended idle mode DRX cycle  The UE can request the use of both PSM and eDRX during an attach or tracking area updating procedure but it is up to the network to decide to enable none, one of them or both (see 3GPPTS282[11A] and   If the network accepts the use of both PSM (see clause1) and eDRX (see clause2), the extended DRX parameters IE provided to the UE should allow for multiple paging occasions before the active timer   4 Dedicated core network  The network may reject mobility management signalling requests from UEs due to dedicated core network as specified in 3GPPTS201.
 When the network rejects mobility management signalling requests due to dedicated core network, the mechanism for general NAS level mobility management congestion control as specified in clause shall be   5 CIoT EPS optimizations  CIoT EPS optimizations provide improved support of small data and SMS transfer.
 A UE supporting CIoT EPS optimizations can indicate the CIoT network behaviour the UE can support and prefers to use during attach or tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPPTS201).
 The UE may indicate the support for control plane CIoT EPS optimization, user plane CIoT EPS optimization, EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, SU data transfer and header compression (see clause4).
 The UE may also request to use SMS transfer without combined attach procedure during the attach procedure.
 Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization (see clauseB). The indication of preference is also considered as the request to use.
 A UE supporting CIoT 5GS optimizations can also indicate the 5GS CIoT network behaviour the UE can support during attach or tracking area updating procedure.
 Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization or user plane CIoT 5GS optimization.  NOTE1: The UE supporting control plane CIoT EPS optimization and SU data transfer but not user plane CIoT EPS optimization does not indicate preference for user plane CIoT EPS optimization.  The UE can be in NB-S1 mode or WB-S1 mode when requesting the use of CIoT EPS optimizations during an attach or tracking area updating procedure.
 A UE in NB-S1 mode always indicates support for control plane CIoT EPS optimization.
 A UE in NB-S1 mode can also request SMS transfer without combined procedure by using the normal attach or tracking area updating procedure (see clause and\).  In NB-S1 mode, the UE, when requesting the use of CIoT EPS optimization,    request an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;   emergency bearer services with attach type not set to "EPS emergency    indicate voice domain preference and UE's usage setting; or   request an attach for access to RLOS.  The network does not indicate to the UE support of emergency bearer services when the UE is in NB-S1 mode (see clause and   The control plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support of efficient transport of user data (IP, non-IP, Ethernet) or SMS messages over control plane via the MME without triggering data radio bearer establishment.
 The support of control plane CIoT EPS optimization is mandatory for the network in NB-S1 mode and optional in WB-S1 mode. Optional header compression of IP data can be applied to IP PDN type PDN connections that are configured to support header compression.  The user plane CIoT EPS optimization enables support for change from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode without the need for using the service request procedure (see clause).  If the UE indicates support of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection in the attach request, the UE may include an ESM DUMMY MESSAGE instead of a PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message as part of the attach procedure.
 If the EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the network, the UE and the network can at any time release all the PDN connections and the UE still remains EPS attached.  NOTE2: For both the UE and the network, the term "EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection" is equivalent to the term "EPS attach without PDN connectivity" as specified in 3GPPTS201.   tracking area updating procedure, the MME supporting CIoT EPS optimisations provides SMS so that the UE is not required to perform a combined attach or tracking area updating procedure.  If the UE supports user plane CIoT EPS optimization, it shall also support SU data transfer.  If the UE indicates support of one or more CIoT EPS optimizations and the network supports one or more CIoT EPS optimizations and decides to accept the attach or tracking area update request, the network indicates the supported CIoT EPS optimizations to the UE per TAI list when accepting the UE request.
 Network indication of support is interpreted by the UE as the acceptance to use the respective feature.
 After completion of the attach or tracking area updating procedure, the UE and the network can then use the accepted CIoT EPS optimizations for the transfer of user data (IP, non-IP, Ethernet and SMS).  The UE supporting control plane CIoT EPS optimization may indicate support for control plane MT-EDT during the attach or tracking area  which the network has accepted the use of control plane CIoT EPS optimization, the network may trigger the delivery of downlink data to the UE, when available, using procedures for control plane MT-EDT as   The UE supporting user plane CIoT EPS optimization may indicate support for user plane MT-EDT during the attach or tracking area updating  network has accepted the use of user plane CIoT EPS optimization, the network may trigger the delivery of downlink data to the UE, when available, using procedures for user plane MT-EDT as specified in   If the UE and the network support both the control plane CIoT EPS optimization and SU data transfer, then when receiving the UE's  should be SCEF PDN connection or SGi PDN connection as specified in    if SCEF PDN connection is to be established for non-IP data type, the MME shall include Control plane only indication for the requested PDN    if SGi PDN connection is to be established and existing SGi PDN connections for this UE were established with Control plane only indication, the MME shall include Control plane only indication for the newly requested SGi PDN connection;   if SGi PDN connection is to be established and existing SGi PDN connections for this UE were established without Control plane only indication, the MME shall not include Control plane only indication for the newly requested SGi PDN connection; and   if SGi PDN connection is to be established and no SGi PDN connection for this UE exists, the MME determine whether to include Control plane only indication for the requested SGi PDN connection based on local policies, the UE's preferred CIoT network behaviour and the supported   If the network supports user plane CIoT EPS optimization, it shall also support SU data transfer.  Broadcast system information may provide information about support of CIoT EPS optimizations (see 3GPPTS331).
 At reception of new broadcast system information, the lower layers deliver it to the EMM layer in the UE.
 The information provided by lower layers is per PLMN and used by the UE to determine whether certain CIoT EPS optimizations are supported in the cell.  The UE shall not attempt to use CIoT EPS optimizations which are indicated as not supported.   connection and the UE requests the use of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection or user plane CIoT EPS optimization, the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT EPS optimizations to the lower layers. If the UE requests the use of SU data transfer without user plane CIoT optimization, then the UE shall also pass an indication of user plane CIoT EPS optimization to lower layers.   connection and the UE requests the use of EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization, the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT EPS optimizations to the lower layers.  6 Restriction on use of enhanced coverage  In order to deal with use of extensive resources from the network, the operator may prevent specific subscribers from using enhanced coverage (see 3GPPTS201).
 When in NB-S1 mode, the UE shall indicate support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage.
 When in WB-S1 mode,  for restriction on use of enhanced coverage.
 The UE supporting restriction on use of enhanced coverage indicates its support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the ATTACH REQUEST and TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.
 If the UE supports restriction on use of enhanced coverage, the MME indicates whether the use of enhanced coverage is restricted or not in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (see clause and clause).
 If the use of enhanced coverage is restricted, the UE shall not use enhanced coverage in the registered PLMN and in any PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs.     the use of enhanced coverage is not restricted for the UE; or    the applicable NAS timer values shall be calculated by the network as  
7 Service Gap Control  The network may control the frequency UEs can transit from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode via the service gap control (SGC) as specified in 3GPPTS201.
 If the network supports service gap control (SGC) feature and the service gap time value is available in the EMM context of the UE, the MME shall consider SGC as active for the UE.  The UE and the network negotiate usage of the service gap control (SGC) feature during the attach and tracking area updating procedures:   the UE supporting service gap control indicates its support for service gap control in the ATTACH REQUEST and TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.
 If the UE supports service gap control and the SGC is active for the UE, the MME shall include service gap timer T3447 value in the ATTACH ACCEPT message and TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message (see clause and clause).
 The UE shall store the service gap time value; and   for UEs that do not support the optional SGC feature when the network rejects mobility management signalling requests due to service gap control is active in the network, the mechanism for general NAS level mobility management congestion control as specified in clause   The UE shall start the SGC timer T3447 when the NAS signalling connection is released and if:   the UE supports SGC feature, and the service gap timer value is available in the UE and does not indicate zero; and   the NAS signalling connection released was not established for:     attach requests without PDN connection request; or   tracking area update requests without "active" or "signalling active"   If the SGC is active in the network, after the UE transitions from EMM-CONNECTED mode to EMM-IDLE mode except when the UE was in EMM-CONNECTED mode due to:     attach requests without PDN connection request; or   tracking area update requests without "active" or "signalling active"   the network shall start the SGC timer T3447:   with the service gap time value available in the EMM context minus 4 minutes, if the UE supports SGC feature and the service gap time value    with the service gap time value available in the EMM context if the UE does not support SGC feature.  When the SGC timer T3447 is running, the network allows:   requests for emergency bearer services;   requests for exception data reporting;   attach requests without PDN connection request;   tracking area update requests without "active" or "signalling active"    requests from UEs that were received via NAS signalling connections established with RRC establishment cause "High priority access AC 11 –    mobile terminated service requests triggered by paging and subsequent MO signalling or MO data, if any, until the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode.  If the MME determines that the UE operating in single-registration mode has performed an inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode and the timer T3447 is running in the MME, the MME stops the T344  Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, if the UE supports service gap control, T3447 is running in the UE, and the T3447 value is included in the ATTACH ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message received from the MME (see clause and clause), the UE shall keep T3447 running.
 Additionally, the UE shall store and replace the currently stored T3447 value with the received T3447 value. Upon expiry of the running T3447 timer, the UE shall use the new value when starting T3447 again.   timer running when the UE transits from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED   NOTE: If the UE transitions from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode due to attach request without PDN connection request or tracking area update request without "active" or "signalling active" flag set, the UE initiates no further MO signalling except for tracking area update request without "active" or "signalling active" flag set until the UE receives network-initiated signalling (e.
g.
 DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message for MT SMS) or MT data over user plane, or after the UE has moved to EMM-IDLE state and the service gap timer is not running.  If the timer T3447 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3447 is kept running until it expires.  If the UE is switched off when the timer T3447 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE    let t1 be the time remaining for T3447 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on.
 If t1 is greater thant, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t.
 If t1   with the value t  8 Restricted local operator services  Restricted local operator services (RLOS) is an optional feature that enables operators to offer access to restricted local operator services to the unauthenticated UEs in limited service state (see 3GPPTS201).
 Authenticated UEs in limited service state may also be able to access restricted local operator services.
 The UE requests access to RLOS during the attach procedure by setting the attach type to "EPS RLOS attach" in the ATTACH REQUEST message.
 Subject to regulation and local operator policy, if the MME is configured to support access to RLOS, the MME accepts the UE's attach request regardless of the authentication result or skips the authentication   When the UE requests the lower layer to establish an RRC connection for access to RLOS, the UE indicates in the RRC signalling that the RRC connection is for access to RLOS to the lower layers.  The UE supporting access to RLOS shall perform PLMN selection according to 3GPPTS222.
 Broadcast system information may provide information about support of access to RLOS (see 3GPPTS331). At reception of new broadcast system information, the lower layers deliver it to the EMM layer in the UE.
 The information provided by lower layers is per PLMN and used by the UE to determine whether the PLMN is configured to support access to RLOS.
 The UE shall not attempt to request access to RLOS if the PLMN does not support access to RLOS.  NOTE: Only authorized applications on the UE are allowed to trigger the initiation of RLOS connection (see 3GPPTS301).  For UE attached for access to RLOS, only UE originated access to RLOS requests are supported.
 Mobile terminated access to RLOS request and network triggered service request are not allowed.
 The UE is not allowed to initiate UE requested PDN connectivity for any additional PDN connection.
 In addition, intersystem change to other RAT including GERAN and UTRAN and handover between 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are not   Access to RLOS is applicable to the UEs in WB-S1 mode only.
 The UEs in NB-S1 mode shall not request access to RLOS.  Location service does not apply to access to RLOS.    procedure for emergency bearer services.  9 Core Network selection and redirection for UEs using CIoT optimizations    A UE that supports CIoT optimizations performs core network selection as specified in clauseA.
1 of 3GPPTS201.   Redirection of the UE by the core network   EPC and 5GCN as specified in clause of 3GPPTS201.
 The network can take into account the UE's N1 mode capability or S1 mode capability, the CIoT network behaviour supported and preferred by the UE or the CIoT network behaviour supported by the network to determine the   NOTE: It is assumed that the network would avoid redirecting the UE back and forth between EPC and 5GCN.  The network redirects the UE to 5GCN by rejecting the attach request, or tracking area update request, or service request with the EMM cause #31 "Redirection to 5GCN required" as specified in  receipt of reject message, the UE disables the E-UTRA capability as specified in clause and enables the N1 mode capability if it was disabled in order to move to 5GCN.   5GCN to EPC as specified in clauseA.
2 of 3GPPTS201.  0 UE radio capability signalling optimisation   optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see 3GPPTS201).
 RACS works by assigning an identifier to represent a set of UE radio capabilities.
 This identifier is called the UE radio capability ID.
 A UE radio capability ID can be either manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned.
 The UE radio capability ID is an alternative to the signalling of the radio capabilities container over the radio interface.  In this release of the specification, RACS is not applicable to NB-S1   If the UE supports RACS:   the UE shall indicate support for RACS by setting the RACS bit to "RACS supported" in the UE network capability IE of the ATTACH REQUEST and TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST messages;   if the UE performs an attach procedure and the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE radio capability ID availability IE in the ATTACH REQUEST message and set the IE to "UE radio capability ID available";   an applicable UE radio capability ID for the current UE radio configuration in the selected network, the UE shall include the UE radio capability ID availability IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and set the IE to "UE radio capability ID available";   If the UE is requested to provide the UE radio capability ID by the  the UE radio capability ID in the UE radio capability ID IE of the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message according to the rules in clause    if the radio configuration at the UE changes (for instance because the   a) if the UE has an applicable UE radio capability ID for the new UE   the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and set the URCIDA bit to "UE radio capability ID available" in the UE radio capability ID availability IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message; and  b) if the UE does not have an applicable UE radio capability ID for the   update needed IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message;  NOTE: Performing the tracking area updating procedure with the UE radio capability information update needed IE included in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message and without the UE radio capability ID availability IE set to "UE radio capability ID available" in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message as specified in b) above can    ACCEPT message, in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or in the GUTI REALLOCATION COMMAND message, the UE shall store the network-assigned UE radio capability ID and the PLMN ID of the serving  its non-volatile memory as specified in annexC.

 The UE supporting WUS assistance may include its UE paging probability information in the Requested WUS assistance information IE during an attach or tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPPTS201).
 The UE shall not include its UE paging probability    an attach for emergency bearer services procedure;   bearer services with attach type not set to "EPS emergency attach";   emergency bearer services; or.   established for emergency bearer services.  The UE and the network may negotiate the UE paging probability information during an attach or tracking area updating procedure when the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services.
 The UE paging probability information is an assistance information used to determine the WUS group for paging UE (see 3GPPTS201,   NOTE: The determination of UE paging probability information is up to UE   If the UE is not attached for emergency bearer services and the network accepts the use of the WUS assistance for the UE, the network determines the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE based on the requested UE paging probability information, if any, local configuration or previous statistical information for the UE, and then indicates the negotiated UE paging probability information in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE to the UE when accepting the attach or the tracking area updating procedure.

  The purpose of the EPS authentication and key agreement (AKA) procedure is to provide mutual authentication between the user and the network and  EPS AKA procedure should be used are defined in 3GPPTS301.  The EPS AKA procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network. However, the UE can reject the EPS authentication challenge sent by the      A partial native EPS security context is established in the UE and the network when an EPS authentication is successfully performed.
 During a successful EPS authentication procedure, the CK and IK are computed by the USIM.
 CK and IK are then used by the ME as key material to compute a new key, K_(ASME).
 K_(ASME) is stored in the EPS security contexts (see 3GPPTS301) of both the network and in the volatile memory of the ME while attached to the network, and is the root for the EPS integrity protection and ciphering key hierarchy.   Authentication initiation by the network   authentication procedure at any time.
 For restrictions applicable after handover or inter-system handover to S1 mode see clause  The network initiates the authentication procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE and starting the timer T3460 (see example in figure).
 The AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message contains the parameters necessary to calculate the authentication   If an eKSI is contained in an initial NAS message during an EMM  AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message when it initiates an authentication        Authentication response by the UE  The UE shall respond to an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
 With the exception of the cases described in clauses and case k, the UE shall process the authentication challenge data and respond with an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network.   the PLMN identity to be used for the calculation of the new K_(ASME) from the authentication challenge data according to the following rules:  a) When the UE moves from EMM-IDLE mode to EMM-CONNECTED mode, until the first handover, the UE shall use the PLMN identity of the selected PLMN;   b) After handover or inter-system handover to S1 mode,   PLMN identity received as part of the broadcast system information;   GUTI, the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the GUTI; and      the EPS authentication challenge is performed after inter-system handover from A/Gb mode to S1 mode or from Iu mode to S1 mode and the UE  part of the RAI; or   the EPS authentication challenge is performed after inter-system  shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the 5G-GUTI.   calculated from the authentication challenge data shall be stored in a new EPS security context in the volatile memory of the ME.  The USIM will compute the authentication response (RES) using the authentication challenge data received from the ME, and pass RES to the    AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the UE shall store the received RAND together with the RES returned from the USIM in the volatile memory of  message, if the stored RAND value is equal to the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, then the ME shall not pass the RAND to the USIM, but shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with the stored RES.
 If there is no valid stored RAND in the ME or the stored RAND is different from the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the ME shall pass the RAND to the USIM, shall override any previously stored RAND and RES with the new ones and start, or reset and restart timer T341  The RAND and RES values stored in the ME shall be deleted and timer T3416, if running, shall be stopped:   upon receipt of a         TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT,   TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT, or     upon expiry of timer T3416;   if the UE enters the EMM state EMM-DEREGISTERED or EMM-NULL; or   if the UE enters EMM-IDLE mode.   Authentication completion by the network  Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the network stops the timer T3460 and checks the correctness of RES (see   If the authentication procedure has been completed successfully and the related eKSI is stored in the EPS security context of the network, the    Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, the network stops the timer T346 In the case where the EMM cause #21 "synch failure" is received, the core network may renegotiate with the HSS/AuC and provide the UE with new authentication parameters.   Authentication not accepted by the network  If the authentication response (RES) returned by the UE is not valid, the network response depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in the initial NAS message, that is:   if the GUTI was used; or   if the IMSI was used.  If the GUTI was used, the network should initiate an identification procedure.
 If the IMSI given by the UE during the identification procedure differs from the IMSI the network had associated with the GUTI, the authentication should be restarted with the correct parameters.
 Otherwise, if the IMSI provided by the UE is the same as the IMSI stored in the network (i.
e.
 authentication has really failed), the network should send an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE.  If the IMSI was used for identification in the initial NAS message, or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure after an unsuccessful authentication procedure, the network should send an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE.
 The network shall maintain, if any, the EMM-context and EPS security context unchanged.  Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message,  a) if the message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS, the UE shall set the update status to EU3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete the stored GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and KSI_(ASME).

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall in addition handle the 5GMM parameters 5GMM state, 5GS update status, 5G-GUTI, last visited registered TAI, TAI list and ngKSI as specified in 3GPPTS201 for the case when the authentication procedure performed over 3GPP access is not accepted by the network; and  b) if the message is received without integrity protection and if timer   between 30 minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is not running (see clauseb).
 Additionally, the UE shall:    implementation-specific maximum value, proceed as specified in clauseb, list item 1a for the case that the EMM cause value received is #3; and   that the message has been successfully integrity checked.  If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the UE, the UE shall abort any EMM signalling procedure, stop any of the timers T3410, T3416,    Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency   bearer services, the MME need not follow the procedures specified for the authentication failure in the present clause.
 The MME may continue a current EMM specific procedure or PDN connectivity request procedure. Upon completion of the authentication procedure, if not initiated as part of another procedure, or upon completion of the EMM procedure or PDN connectivity request procedure, the MME shall deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers, if any, by initiating an EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.
 The network shall consider the UE to be attached for emergency bearer services only.  Depending on local regulation and operator policy, if the UE is requesting attach for access to RLOS, the MME need not follow the procedures specified for the authentication failure in the present    Authentication not accepted by the UE  In an EPS authentication challenge, the UE shall check the authenticity of the core network by means of the AUTN parameter received in the    During an EPS authentication procedure, the UE may reject the core network due to an incorrect AUTN parameter (see 3GPPTS301). This parameter contains three possible causes for authentication   a) MAC code failure:  If the UE finds the MAC code (supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter) to be invalid, the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the EMM cause #20 "MAC failure".
 The UE shall then follow the procedure described in clause, itemc.  b) Non-EPS authentication unacceptable:  If the UE finds that the "separation bit" in the AMF field of AUTN supplied by the core network is 0, the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the EMM cause #26 "non-EPS authentication unacceptable" (see clause in 3GPPTS301). The UE shall then follow the procedure described in clause, item     If the UE finds the SQN (supplied by the core network in the AUTN parameter) to be out of range, the UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, with the EMM cause #21 "synch failure"  3GPPTS302).
 The UE shall then follow the procedure described   If the UE returns an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the network, the UE shall delete any previously stored RAND and RES and shall stop timer             a) Lower layer failure:  Upon detection of lower layer failure before the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message is received, the network shall abort the procedure.  b) Expiry of timer T3460:  The network shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3460, retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T346 This retransmission is repeated four times, i.

 Furthermore, the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.
g.
 T3410, T3417, T3421 or T3430).
 Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with EMM cause #20 "MAC failure", the network may initiate the identification procedure described in clause This is to allow the network to obtain the IMSI from the UE.
 The network may then check that the GUTI originally used in the authentication challenge corresponded to the correct IMSI.

 IMEI and IMSI definition and structure are specified in 3GPPTS203.  For mobile device supporting both 3GPP access and cdma2000^(®) access a single IMEI is used to identify the device as specified in  IMEI for each USIM the UE operates.   Identification initiation by the network  The network initiates the identification procedure by sending an IDENTITY REQUEST message to the UE and starting the timer T3470 (see example in figure).
 The IDENTITY REQUEST message specifies the requested identification parameters in the Identity type information        Identification response by the UE  A UE shall be ready to respond to an IDENTITY REQUEST message at any time whilst in EMM-CONNECTED mode.  Upon receipt of the IDENTITY REQUEST message the UE shall send an IDENTITY RESPONSE message to the network.

e.
 on the fifth expiry of timer T3470, the network shall abort the identification procedure and any ongoing EMM procedure.  c) Collision of an identification procedure with an attach procedure  If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed and no attach procedure is pending on the network (i.
e.
 no ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has still to be sent as an answer to an ATTACH REQUEST message), the network shall proceed with the attach procedure.  d) Collision of an identification procedure with an attach procedure when the identification procedure has been caused by an attach procedure  If the network receives an ATTACH REQUEST message before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed and an attach procedure is pending (i.
e.
 an ATTACH ACCEPT/REJECT message has to be sent as an answer to an earlier ATTACH REQUEST message), then:   If one or more of the information elements in the ATTACH REQUEST message differ from the ones received within the previous ATTACH REQUEST message, the network shall proceed with the new attach procedure; or   If the information elements do not differ, then the network shall not treat any further this new ATTACH REQUEST.

If the network receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message for CS fallback or 1xCS fallback before the ongoing identification procedure has been completed, the network shall progress both procedures.  h) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover  If the IDENTITY REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit  reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the IDENTITY REQUEST message.   
  The purpose of sending the EMM INFORMATION message is to allow the network to provide information to the UE.
 The message implementation is optional in the network.
 The UE may use the received information if the UE supports implementing this message.  The EMM information procedure may be invoked by the network at any time during an established EMM context.   EMM information procedure initiation by the network  The EMM information procedure consists only of the EMM INFORMATION message sent from the network to the UE (see example in figure).
 During an established EMM context, the network may send none, one, or more EMM INFORMATION messages to the UE.
 If more than one EMM INFORMATION message is sent, the messages need not have the same        EMM information procedure in the UE  When the UE (supporting the EMM information message) receives an EMM INFORMATION message, it shall accept the message and optionally use the contents to update appropriate information stored within the UE.  If the UE does not support the EMM information message the UE shall ignore the contents of the message and return an EMM STATUS message with EMM cause #97 "message type non-existent or not implemented".   Abnormal cases on the network side  The following abnormal case can be identified:  a) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover  If the EMM INFORMATION message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit  reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the EMM INFORMATION message.

 When timer T3402 expires the normal tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" or the combined tracking area updating procedure for EPS services and "SMS only" is triggered; and  2) otherwise, the abnormal cases specified in clause apply.   Abnormal cases on the network side  The following abnormal cases can be identified:    assigned, the network shall abort the procedure, enter EMM-IDLE mode and shall consider both, the old and new GUTI as valid until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network (see clause).
 During this period the network may use the identification procedure followed by a GUTI reallocation procedure if the old GUTI is used by the UE in a   The network may page with IMSI if paging with old and new S-TMSI fails. Paging with IMSI causes the UE to re-attach as described in   Additionally, if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message includes:   previously had another negotiated IMSI offset value assigned;   negotiated IMSI offset value assigned; or   no negotiated IMSI offset value assigned;  for case 1) the network shall use two alternative IMSI values and for case 2) and 3) the network shall use one alternative IMSI value and the IMSI value for paging the UE until one of the two (alternative) IMSI values can be considered as invalid by the network.   value is changed or deleted (see clause\), the network can consider the alternative IMSI value associated with the old GUTI as invalid if the UE responds to the paging with the new GUTI.  If the UE supports WUS assistance, the MME supports and accepts the use of WUS assistance and if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message   1) a different negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE  probability information for the UE assigned;  2) no negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE assigned  for the UE assigned; or  3) a negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE assigned to a UE that previously had no negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE assigned;  for case 1) the network shall use two UE paging probability information for the UE values and for case 2) and 3) the network shall use one UE paging probability information for the UE value for paging the UE until one of the two UE paging probability information for the UE values can be considered as invalid by the network.   information for the UE value is changed or deleted (see clause ), the network can consider the UE paging probability information for the UE value associated with the old GUTI as invalid if the UE responds to the paging with the new GUTI.    If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message has been received with a  message with one of the following EMM cause values:  #96: invalid mandatory information element error;  #99: information element non-existent or not implemented;  #100: conditional IE error; or  #111: protocol error, unspecified.    On the first expiry of the timer, the network shall retransmit the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message and shall reset and restart timer T345 The retransmission is performed four times, i.
e.
 on the fifth expiry of timer T3450, the tracking area updating procedure is aborted. Both, the old and the new GUTI shall be considered as valid until the old GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network (see clause).
 During this period the network acts as described for   d) TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST received after the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message has been sent and before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is received  If one or more of the information elements in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message differ from the ones received within the previous TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the previously initiated tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted if the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message has not been received and the new tracking area updating procedure shall be progressed; or  If the information elements do not differ for cases other than inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode with the UE operating in the single-registration mode, then the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message shall be resent and the timer T3450 shall be restarted if a TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message is expected.
 If the information elements do not differ for the case of inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode with the UE operating in the single-registration mode, the MME should forward the new TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message which contains the same information elements as the previous TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the source AMF to run the integrity check, obtain the latest mapped EPS security context (to be used to protect any future NAS message sent to the UE) and continue with the new tracking area updating procedure.
 In these cases, the retransmission counter related to T3450 is not incremented.  NOTE3: Instead of forwarding the new TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message which contains the same information elements to the source AMF, the MME can decide to initiate an authentication procedure followed by a security mode control procedure to take the new partial native EPS security context into use if the new partial native EPS security context is taken into use successfully, then resend the same TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message protected using this new EPS security context.  e) More than one TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST received and no TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message has been sent  If one or more of the information elements in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message differs from the ones received within the previous TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message, the previously initiated tracking area updating procedure shall be aborted and the new tracking area updating procedure shall be progressed;  if the information elements do not differ for cases other than inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode with the UE operating in the single-registration mode, then the network shall continue with the previous tracking area updating procedure and shall not treat any further this TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.
 If the information elements do not differ for the case of inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in EMM-IDLE mode with the UE operating in the single-registration mode, the MME should forward the new TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message which contains the same information elements as the previous TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message to the source AMF to run the integrity check, obtain the latest mapped EPS security context (to be used to protect any future NAS message sent to the UE) and continue with the previous tracking area updating procedure.  NOTE4: Instead of forwarding the new TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message which contains the same information elements to the source AMF, the MME can decide to initiate an authentication procedure followed by a security mode control procedure to take the new partial native EPS security context into use and, if the new partial native EPS security context is taken into use successfully, use this new EPS security context to protect any future NAS message sent to the UE.  f) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover  If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the TAI of the target cell and the TAI of the source cell are the same, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA  reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message or TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message.  g) DETACH REQUEST message received before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE ACCEPT message is sent or before the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message (in case of GUTI and/or TMSI was allocated) is received.  Detach containing cause "switch off":  The network shall abort the signalling for the tracking area updating procedure towards the UE and shall progress the detach procedure as   NOTE5: Internally in the network, before processing the detach request, the MME can perform the necessary signalling procedures for the tracking area updating procedure before progressing the detach procedure.  Detach containing other causes than "switch off":  The network shall proceed with the tracking area updating procedure and shall progress the detach procedure after successful completion of the tracking area updating procedure.  h) If the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message with EPS update type IE indicating "periodic updating" is received by the new MME which does not have the EMM context data related to the subscription, the new MME may send the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REJECT message with EMM cause value #10    Combined tracking area updating procedure

  This clause describes the procedures used for EPS session management (ESM) at the radio interface (reference point "LTE-Uu").  The main function of the ESM sublayer is to support the EPS bearer context handling in the UE and in the MME.  The ESM comprises procedures for:   the activation, deactivation and modification of EPS bearer contexts;   bearer resources) by the UE; and   the transport of user data via the control plane between the UE and   Each EPS bearer context represents an EPS bearer between the UE and a PDN.
 EPS bearer contexts can remain activated even if the radio and S1 bearers constituting the corresponding EPS bearers between UE and MME      A default EPS bearer context is activated when the UE requests a   Generally, ESM procedures can be performed only if an EMM context has been established between the UE and the MME, and the secure exchange of NAS messages has been initiated by the MME by use of the EMM procedures described in clause The first default EPS bearer context, however, can be activated during the EPS attach procedure (see clause).
 Once the UE is successfully attached, and the first default EPS bearer context has been activated during or after the attach procedure, the UE can request the MME to set up connections to additional PDNs.

 The network can initiate the activation of dedicated EPS bearer contexts together with the activation of the default EPS bearer context or at any time later, as long as the default EPS bearer context  bearer context activation procedure for established PDN connection(s) of "non IP" PDN type.  Default and dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be modified.
 Dedicated EPS bearer contexts can be released without affecting the default EPS bearer context.
 When the default EPS bearer context is released, then all dedicated EPS bearer contexts linked to it are released too.  The UE can request the network to allocate, modify or release EPS bearer   context or deactivating an EPS bearer context.   Types of ESM procedures  Two types of ESM procedures can be distinguished:  1) Procedures related to EPS bearer contexts:  These procedures are initiated by the network and are used for the manipulation of EPS bearer contexts:   default EPS bearer context activation;   dedicated EPS bearer context activation;   EPS bearer context modification;   EPS bearer context deactivation.  This procedure is initiated by the network or by the UE and is used for the transport of user data via the control plane:   transport of user data via the control plane procedure.  2) Transaction related procedures:  These procedures are initiated by the UE to request for resources, i.
e. a new PDN connection or dedicated bearer resources, or to release these        bearer resource allocation procedure;   bearer resource modification procedure.  This procedure is initiated by the ProSe UE-to-network relay and is used for the manipulation of EPS bearer contexts:    When combined with the attach procedure, the PDN connectivity procedure can trigger the network to execute the following transaction related    ESM information request procedure.  When combined with the attach procedure, if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the network and no PDN connectivity procedure is initiated during the attach procedure, the UE or the network executes the following transaction related procedure:   ESM dummy message procedure.  A successful transaction related procedure initiated by the UE triggers the network to execute one of the procedures related to EPS bearer contexts.
 The UE treats the start of the procedure related to the EPS bearer context as completion of the transaction related procedure.  During procedures related to EPS bearer contexts, the MME and the UE shall not initiate the transport of user data via the control plane procedure until the ongoing procedure is completed.  NOTE1: The UE determination of the completion of the transport of user data via the control plane procedure is left to the implementation.  NOTE2: NAS signalling prioritization with respect to the transport of user data via the control plane cannot be guaranteed in the downlink direction in this version of the specification.  Except for the remote UE report procedure and ESM information request procedure, during transaction related procedures, the MME and the UE shall not initiate the transport of user data via the control plane procedure until the ongoing procedure is completed.  The following ESM procedures can be related to an EPS bearer context or        
  In this clause the possible states of EPS bearer contexts in the UE and on the network side are described.
 Each EPS bearer context is associated with an individual state.   ESM sublayer states in the UE    No EPS bearer context exists.    The EPS bearer context is active in the UE.     The ESM sublayer states for EPS bearer context handling in the UE (overview)    No procedure transaction exists.

e.
 R99 QoS, LLC SAPI, radio priority, packet flow identifier, transaction identifier and BCM (if available).
 If the MME also provided an Extended EPS QoS IE, then the bit rates signalled with this IE are also applicable to the R99 QoS.  NOTE2: Some networks not supporting mobility from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode or both do not provide the UE with the GERAN/UTRAN parameters.
 However, for this case there is no need for the UE to perform mapping to GERAN/UTRAN parameters (i.
e.
 the PDP contexts cannot be transferred to A/Gb mode or Iu mode).  The MME performs the mapping from EPS to R99 QoS parameters according to   At inter-system change from S1 mode to A/Gb mode, SM shall not activate the PDP context(s) if SM does not have the following parameters from the active EPS bearer context(s):          At inter-system change from S1 mode to Iu mode, SM shall not activate the PDP context(s) if SM does not have the following parameter from the active EPS bearer context(s):      For inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, ESM uses the following parameters from each active PDP context:   NSAPI to map to EPS bearer identity;   NSAPI of the default PDP context to map to linked EPS bearer identity;   PDP address and APN of the default PDP context to map to PDN address and APN of the default EPS bearer context;   TFT of the default PDP context, if any, to map to the TFT of the default EPS bearer context; and   TFTs of the secondary PDP contexts to map to the TFTs of the dedicated   The MME and the UE perform the mapping from R99 to EPS QoS parameters according to 3GPPTS201, annexE.
 In particular the MME derives the APN-AMBR for the corresponding PDN connection from the MBR of the R99 subscribed QoS profile and the UE maps the MBR of its default PDP context to the APN-AMBR of the corresponding PDN connection.  A Coordination between ESM and 5GSM  See clause in 3GPPTS201.   Coordination between ESM and EMM for supporting ISR  The UE with its TIN set as "RAT‑related TMSI" for which ISR is activated shall change its TIN to "GUTI" to locally deactivate ISR and stop the periodic routing area update timer T3312 or T3323, if running:   upon modification of any EPS bearer context which was activated before the ISR is activated in the UE;   at the time when the UE changes from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode not due to PS handover procedure (see 3GPPTS208), if any EPS bearer context activated after the ISR was activated in the UE exists;    upon deactivation of the last non-emergency EPS bearer context in the    ISR remains activated on the network side in the above cases.   
  The UE can configure an IPv4 address during the establishment of a default EPS bearer context.
 The UE can obtain an IPv4 address or an IPv6 prefix or both via an IETF-based IP address allocation mechanism once the default bearer is established.  The following IETF-based IP address/prefix allocation methods are specified for EPS (the corresponding procedures are specified in   a) /64 IPv6 default prefix allocation via IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration.
 Optionally, allocation of additional IPv6 prefix(es) with length /64 or shorter via stateful DHCPv6 Prefix Delegation (see   b) IPv4 address allocation and IPv4 parameter configuration via DHCPv4;  c) IPv6 parameter configuration via stateless DHCPv  NOTE: From the perspective of the UE, the procedure used to allocate a static IP address via NAS signalling is the same as the procedure used    shall locally release any IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix allocated to the UE for the corresponding PDN connection.

If the UE wants to get PDN connectivity for non-IP, the UE shall set the PDN type IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to "non IP".
 If the UE wants to get PDN connectivity for Ethernet, the UE shall set the PDN type IE in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to "Ethernet".  On receipt of the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message sent by the UE, the network when allocating an IP address shall take into account the PDN type IE, the operator policies of the home and visited network, and the user's subscription data and:   if the UE requests for PDN type IPv4v6, but the subscription is limited to IPv4 only or IPv6 only for the requested APN, the network shall override the PDN type requested by the UE to be limited to a single address PDN type (IPv4 or IPv6).
 In the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to the UE, the network shall set the PDN type value to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" and the ESM cause value to #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", or #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", respectively.
 The UE shall not subsequently initiate another UE  type different from the one allowed by the network until:      c) the UE is switched off; or  d) the USIM is removed.  NOTE1: Request to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a specific PDN type has to come from upper layers.   if the UE requests PDN type IPv4v6, but the PDN GW configuration dictates the use of IPv4 addressing only or IPv6 addressing only for this APN, the network shall override the PDN type requested by the UE to  DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to the UE, the network shall set the PDN type value to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" and the ESM cause value to #50 "PDN type IPv4 only allowed", or #51 "PDN type IPv6 only allowed", respectively.
 The UE shall not subsequently initiate another UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to the same APN to       c) the UE is switched off; or  d) the USIM is removed.  NOTE2: Request to send another PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message with a specific PDN type has to come from upper layers.   if the UE requests PDN type IPv4v6, but the operator uses single addressing per bearer, e.
g.
 due to interworking with nodes of earlier releases, the network shall override the PDN type requested by the UE to a single IP version only.
 In the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to the UE, the network shall set the PDN type value to either "IPv4" or "IPv6" and the ESM cause value to #52 "single address bearers only allowed".
 The UE should subsequently request another PDN connection for the other IP version using the UE requested  type (IPv4 or IPv6) other than the one already activated;  NOTE3: If the MT and TE are separated, the UE might not be able to use     if the network sets the PDN type to IPv4 or IPv4v6, the network shall include an IPv4 address in the PDN address information.
 In this case, if the IPv4 address is to be configured using DHCPv4, the network shall set the IPv4 address to ; and   if the network sets the PDN type to IPv6 or IPv4v6, the network shall include the interface identifier that the UE shall use for the link local address in the PDN address information.  The network shall include the PDN type and the PDN address information within the PDN address IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message sent to the UE.  A IP header compression  The UE and the MME may support robust header compression (ROHC) framework (see IETFRFC5795) for IP header compression if control plane CIoT EPS optimization is supported for PDN connections of IP PDN type.
 If IP header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization is supported, the ROHC profiles defined in 3GPPTS323 may be supported.
 The ROHC configuration is negotiated and established during the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure as specified in clause Both the UE and the MME indicate whether IP header compression for control plane CIoT EPS optimization is supported during attach and tracking area updating procedures (see clauses and ).
 The ROHC configuration can be re-negotiated by using the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure or the EPS bearer context modification procedure as specified in clauses and    General on elementary ESM procedures   Services provided by lower layers  Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the procedures described in the  between the UE and the MME.   Principles of address handling for ESM procedures  Transaction related procedures use the procedure transaction identity as address parameter in the ESM message header.
 When the UE or the network  procedure transaction identity value in the message header and set the EPS bearer identity to "no EPS bearer identity assigned".
 When the ProSe UE-to-network relay initiates the transaction related procedure remote      PDN CONNECTIVITY REJECT, PDN DISCONNECT REJECT, BEARER RESOURCE ALLOCATION REJECT, BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT, ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message or ESM DUMMY MESSAGE from the network or an ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message or ESM DUMMY MESSAGE from the UE, the sending entity shall include the procedure transaction identity value received with the request message and set the EPS bearer identity to "no EPS bearer identity assigned" (see examples in figures,a and).
 If the response message is the transaction related message REMOTE UE REPORT RESPONSE message from the network, the network shall include the procedure transaction identity value received with the request message and set the EPS bearer identity to the EPS bearer identity value received from the ProSe UE-to-network relay (see example    MESSAGE, the sending entity shall include the received procedure transaction identity value in the message header and set the EPS bearer identity to "no EPS bearer identity assigned".

NOTE3: The ESM procedure can typically be re-initiated using a retransmission mechanism of the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message or ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with new sequence number and message authentication code information thus avoiding to restart the whole procedure.   Abnormal cases in the network  The following abnormal case can be identified:  a) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover  Unless the procedure descriptions in clause, or specify a different behaviour, the following applies:  If the downlink ESM NAS message could not be delivered due to an intra MME handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra MME handover the MME shall retransmit  the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the downlink ESM NAS message.  b) Lower layer indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility when the transport of user data via the control   If the downlink ESM NAS message could not be delivered due to inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility and the MME is not changed, then upon successful completion of inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility the  connected mode mobility is reported by the lower layer and the S1 signalling connection exists, the MME shall retransmit the downlink ESM   NOTE: If the downlink ESM NAS message could not be delivered due to inter-eNodeB connected mode mobility and the MME is changed, the retransmission of downlink ESM NAS message is not supported.   Handling of APN based congestion control  The network may detect and start performing the APN based congestion control when one or more APN congestion criteria as specified in 3GPPTS201 are met.
 The network may store an APN congestion   APN which is used in PDN GW selection procedure as congested APN.
 When APN based congestion control is active, the network may reject session management requests except the modification of bearer resources requests from UEs or disconnect existing PDN connections with ESM cause value #26   In the UE, EPS session management timers T3396 for APN based congestion  with T3396 is the APN provided by the UE when the PDN connection is established.
 If no APN is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or, when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message, then T3396 is associated with no APN.
 For this purpose the UE shall memorize the APN provided to the network during the PDN connection establishment.
 The timer T3396 associated with no APN will never be started due to any ESM procedure related to an emergency PDN connection.
 If the timer T3396 associated with no APN is running or is deactivated, it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an emergency PDN connection.  If timer T3396 is running or is deactivated, the UE is allowed to indicate change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status, initiate PDN disconnection procedure, initiate bearer resource modification procedure to release of bearer resources for the respective APN, and if the UE is a UE configured to use AC11 – 15 in selected PLMN, then the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or any EPS session management procedure for the respective APN.  A Handling of group specific session management congestion control  The network may detect and start performing the group specific session management congestion control when one or more group congestion criteria as specified in 3GPPTS201 are met.
 When group specific session management congestion control is active, the mechanism for APN based congestion control as specified in clause shall be followed.   Handling of network rejection not due to APN based congestion control   management reject message to regulate the time interval at which the UE may retry the same procedure.
 For ESM cause values other than #26 "insufficient resources", the network may also include the re-attempt indicator to indicate whether the UE is allowed to re-attempt the corresponding session management procedure for the same APN in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode after inter-system change.  NOTE1: If the network includes this back-off timer value, then the UE is blocked from sending another ESM request for the same procedure for the same PLMN and APN combination for the specified duration.
 Therefore, the operator needs to exercise caution in determining the use of this    registered in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) can use the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value specified in the NAS configuration MO or in the USIM NAS_(CONFIG) file to derive the re-attempt indicator as specified in clauses, , and   If re-attempt in A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode is allowed, the UE shall consider the back-off timer to be applicable only to the EPS session management in S1 mode for the rejected EPS session management procedure and the given PLMN and APN combination.
 If re-attempt in A/Gb and Iu mode and N1 mode is not allowed, the UE shall consider the back-off timer to be applicable to all three NAS protocols, i.
e.
 applicable to the EPS session management in S1 mode for the rejected EPS session management procedure, to the GPRS session management in A/Gb and Iu mode for the corresponding session management procedure and the given PLMN and APN combination and to the 5GS session management in N1 mode for the corresponding session management procedure and the given PLMN and APN   NOTE3: In the present clause the terms APN and DNN are referring to the   The APN of the PLMN and APN combination associated with the back-off timer is the APN provided by the UE when the PDN connection is established.
 If no APN is included in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST or, when applicable, in the ESM INFORMATION RESPONSE message, then the back-off timer is associated with the combination of the PLMN and no APN.
 For this purpose the UE shall memorize the APN provided to the network during the PDN connection establishment.
 The back-off timer  started due to any ESM procedure related to an emergency PDN connection.  APN is running, it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an   The network may additionally indicate in the re-attempt indicator that a command to back-off is applicable not only for the PLMN in which the UE received the EPS session management reject message, but for each PLMN included in the equivalent PLMN list at the time when the EPS session management reject message was received.    selected PLMN, then the UE is allowed to initiate an attach procedure or any EPS session management procedure for this PLMN and APN combination.   Handling of WLAN offload control  In networks that support offloading of traffic to WLAN, as specified in 3GPPTS331, a permission to offload is determined for the UE and the PDN connection in accordance with 3GPPTS201    Handling of serving PLMN rate control  Serving PLMN rate control enables the serving PLMN to protect its MME and the signalling radio bearers in the E-UTRAN from load generated by NAS messages with user data over control plane.
 The MME can inform the UE of any local serving PLMN rate control during the default EPS bearer context activation procedure (see clause).
 If the serving PLMN rate control is enabled, the MME shall start the serving PLMN rate control for the PDN connection when the first NAS message with user data over control plane is received over the PDN connection.
 The UE shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink NAS messages with user data over control plane to comply with the serving PLMN policy provided by  connection the NAS procedure corresponds to, and the indicated rate is valid until the PDN connection is released.  Serving PLMN rate control is applicable for PDN connections established for control plane CIoT EPS optimization only.  Any serving PLMN rate control information provided by the network to the UE is only applicable for the PLMN which provided this information.
 This serving PLMN rate control information shall be discarded when the UE successfully registers to another PLMN.  NOTE: The serving PLMN can discard or delay NAS messages including user data over control plane that exceed the limit provided for serving PLMN    Handling of APN rate control  APN rate control controls the maximum number of uplink user data messages including uplink exception data reporting sent by the UE in a time interval for the APN in accordance with 3GPPTS201.
 The UE shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink user data messages to comply with the APN rate control policy.
 The NAS shall provide the indicated rates to upper layers for enforcement.
 The indicated rates in a NAS procedure applies to the APN the NAS procedure corresponds to, and  PDN connection using this APN is released.  If the UE supports APN rate control, the UE shall provide the support indication of APN rate control and additional APN rate control for exception data reporting to the network.
 If the UE indicates support of additional APN rate control for exception data reporting, the network may provide the APN rate control parameters for exception data to the UE.
 If the UE does not indicate support of additional APN rate control for exception data reporting, the network shall not provide the APN rate control parameters for exception data to the UE.  If an allowed indication of additional exception reports is provided with the APN rate control parameters and:   the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data is provided and the limit for additional rate for exception data reporting is not reached; or   the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data is not   the UE is allowed to send uplink exception reports even if the limit for the APN rate control has been reached.  NOTE1: The HPLMN can discard or delay user data that exceeds the limit provided for APN rate control.  Upon inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE shall store the current APN rate control status for each APN associated with PDN connection(s) to be transferred from S1 mode to N1 mode as specified in   NOTE2: How long the UE stores the current APN rate control status is   Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall use the stored APN rate control status, if any, to comply with the APN rate control policy for an APN as specified in 3GPPTS201 if:  a) there is at least one PDN connection associated with this APN was transferred from N1 mode to S1 mode; and  b) the validity period of the stored APN rate control status has not   After inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if all the PDU sessions associated with the same APN that was used in S1 mode are released, the UE shall delete the stored APN rate control status for   0 Handling of 3GPP PS data off  A UE, which supports 3GPP PS data off (see 3GPPTS201), can be configured with up to two lists of 3GPP PS data off exempt services as specified in 3GPPTS268[15A] or in the EF_(3GPPPSDATAOFF) USIM file as specified in 3GPPTS302:   a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present); and   a list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN.  If only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) is configured at the UE, this list shall be also used in the VPLMN.  If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, the UE shall provide the 3GPP PS data off UE status in the Protocol configuration options IE during attach, UE-requested PDN connectivity, and UE-requested bearer resource modification procedure (see clause, , and\).  NOTE1: The sending of the 3GPP PS data off UE status to the network happens also when the user activates or deactivates 3GPP PS data off while connected via WLAN access only, and then handover to 3GPP access   The network informs the UE about the support of 3GPP PS data off during  clause).
 If 3GPP PS data off support is not indicated in the Protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall not indicate any change of 3GPP PS data off UE status for the PDN connection established by the default EPS bearer context activation procedure; otherwise the UE shall indicate change of the 3GPP PS data off UE status for the PDN connection by using the UE-requested bearer resource modification procedure as specified in clause If the network does not provide indication of support of 3GPP PS data off during default EPS bearer context activation procedure of the PDN connection, the UE behaviour for non-exempt service requests from the network is implementation dependent.  When the 3GPP PS data off UE status is "activated":  a) the UE does not send uplink IP packets except:   for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) as specified in 3GPPTS268[15A] when the UE is in its HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present);   for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) when the UE is in the VPLMN, if only the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the HPLMN or EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) is configured to the UE as specified in    for those services indicated in the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN when the UE is in the VPLMN, if the list of 3GPP PS data off exempt services to be used in the VPLMN is configured to the UE as specified in 3GPPTS268[15A];   for those services indicated in the EF_(3GPPPSDATAOFF) USIM file as    any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in    any uplink traffic due to procedures specified in 3GPPTS223;   b) the UE does not send uplink non-IP or Ethernet user data packets.  Otherwise the UE sends uplink user data packets without restriction.  NOTE2: If the UE supports 3GPP PS data off, uplink IP packets are filtered as specified in 3GPPTS229[13D] in L.  1 Handling of Reliable Data Service  If the UE supports Reliable Data Service (see 3GPPTS250), the  connection in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during attach and UE-requested PDN connectivity procedures (see clause   The Reliable Data Service may only be used with PDN connections for which the "Control plane only" indicator is set or with PDN connections using the control plane CIoT EPS optimization when the MME does not move such PDN connections to the user plane.  The SCEF or P-GW shall inform the UE about the acceptance of UE's request for Reliable Data Service usage during the activation of the  protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER   If the SCEF or P-GW accepts the use of Reliable Data Service to transfer data for the specified PDN connection, the UE shall use this PDN connection exclusively for data transfer using Reliable Data Service; otherwise the UE shall not use this PDN connection for data transfer using Reliable Data Service.  2 Handling of Ethernet PDN type  A UE may support the Ethernet PDN type.
 A network may support the   3 Handling of Uncrewed aerial vehicle identification, authentication, and authorization 
  An EPS can support uncrewed aerial vehicle identification, authentication, and authorization (see 3GPPTS256).  Before accessing EPS for UAS services, the UE supporting UAS services must have an assigned CAA-level UAV ID.   Authentication and authorization of UAV   communication during attach and UE-requested PDN connectivity procedures (see clause and\).
 In the request of the PDN connection for USS communication, the UE provides CAA-level UAV ID to the network via the protocol configuration options and the network may decide to perform  services may provide to the network the USS address via the protocol configuration options during attach and UE-requested PDN connectivity procedures so that the network may use the information to discover the   After successful UUAA-SM procedure, the network may initiate the re-authentication or re-authorization procedure for the UE supporting  modification procedure.
 If UUAA-SM fails during the re-authentication or a re-authorization procedure, or if the revocation of UUAA is initiated by the network, then the associated PDN connection for USS communication    Authorization of C2 communication  The network supports C2 communication authorization for pairing of UAV and UAV-C.
 The pairing of UAV and UAV-C needs to be authorized by USS successfully before the user plane connectivity for C2 communication (over Uu or over NR-PC5) is enabled.
 The UE supporting UAS services may provide the network with an identification information of UAV-C to pair with, if available, via the protocol configuration options as follows:    can be authorized using UUAA-SM procedure during the PDN connectivity procedure or during the bearer resource modification procedure.
 If the pairing of UAV and UAV-C is revoked, the network shall disable C2 communication for the PDN connection.  NOTE 1: The network can disable C2 communication for the PDN connection e.
g.
, by removing the packet filter(s) allocated for C2 communication during EPS bearer context modification procedure as specified in clause or by deactivating the EPS bearer context for C2 communication during EPS bearer context deactivation procedure as    If the UE uses separate PDN connectivity for, respectively, USS  with the UAV-C is authorized using UUAA-SM during the PDN connectivity procedure.
 If the pairing of UAV and UAV-C is revoked, the PDN connectivity or C2 communication shall be released by the network.  The authorization of direct C2 communication can be performed during the C2 communication authorization procedure.  NOTE2: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload, sent to the network via the protocol configuration options, can include an indication of the request for direct C2 communication and pairing information for direct C2 communication (see subclauses and   The authorization of UAV flight can also be performed during the C2 communication authorization procedure.
 The UE supporting UAS services provides flight authorization information to the network via the protocol configuration options if the flight authorization information is already available in the UE. 
 
  4 Handling of URSP provisioning  The UE can perform the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to transport the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicator as specified in  provisioning in EPS support indicator from the network to the UE.
 The successful exchange of the URSP provisioning in EPS support indicators, if the extended protocol configuration options is supported by the network and the UE end-to-end for the PDN connection as specified in subclause, enables the UE to thereafter perform the UE requested  container with the length of two octets as specified in 3GPPTS208 from the UE to the network to transfer the UE STATE INDICATION message as specified in 3GPPTS201 annexD.  Thereafter, the network can initiate the EPS bearer context modification procedure or the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure to transport UE policy container with the length of two octets as specified in 3GPPTS208 from the network to the UE.
 The UE can transport UE policy container with the length of two octets from the UE to the network using the EPS bearer context modification procedure or the dedicated EPS context activation procedure.
 The UE policy container with the length of two octets enable the transfer of the messages specified   If the UE while in N1 mode has indicated support for URSP provisioning in EPS as specified in 3GPPTS201 annexD, the UE performs inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE has not yet provided a UE policy container with the length of two octets to the network as specified in 3GPPTS208 during the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure, or EPS bearer context modification procedure, then  to the UE as specified in 3GPPTS208 during the dedicated EPS bearer context activation procedure, or EPS bearer context modification procedure on any PDN connection.   Network initiated ESM procedures   Default EPS bearer context activation procedure 
  The purpose of the default bearer context activation procedure is to  default EPS bearer context activation procedure is initiated by the  UE.
 The default bearer context activation procedure can be part of the attach procedure, and if the attach procedure fails, the UE shall consider that the default bearer activation has implicitly failed.
 The default EPS bearer context does not have any TFT assigned during the  filter.
 The network may at any time after the establishment of this  modify the TFT or the packet filters of this default bearer.   Default EPS bearer context activation initiated by the network  The MME shall initiate the default bearer context activation procedure by sending an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE PENDING (see example in figure).
 When the default bearer is activated as part of the attach procedure, the MME shall send the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message together with ATTACH ACCEPT and shall not start the timer T348 When the default bearer is activated as the response to a stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message apart from the attach procedure, the MME shall send the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message alone, and start the timer T348  The MME shall assign and include an EPS bearer identity in the ACTIVATE  specified by clause The MME shall retrieve the PTI from the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message and include it in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.
 Both the network identifier part and the operator identifier part shall be included in the Access Point Name IE.     Default EPS bearer context activation procedure   Default EPS bearer context activation accepted by the UE  Upon receipt of the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, if the UE provided an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection, the UE shall stop timer T3396 if it is running for the APN provided by the UE.
 If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running.
 If the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received in response to a request for an emergency PDN connection, the UE shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running.
 For any case, the UE shall then send an ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT ACTIVE.
 When the default bearer is activated as part of the attach procedure, the UE shall send the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message together with ATTACH COMPLETE message.
 When the default bearer is activated as the response to the stand-alone PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message, the UE shall send the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message alone.   ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the WLAN offload acceptability values for this PDN connection and use the E-UTRAN offload acceptability value to determine whether this PDN connection is offloadable to WLAN or not.  The UE checks the PTI in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message to identify the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure to which the default bearer context activation is related (see clause).   DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the serving PLMN rate control IE value and use the stored serving PLMN rate control value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink User data container IEs included in ESM DATA TRANSPORT messages for the corresponding PDN connection in accordance with 3GPPTS201.  If the UE receives an APN rate control parameters container in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the APN rate control parameters value and use the stored APN rate control parameters value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink user data related to the APN indicated in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message in accordance with  parameters value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored APN rate control parameters value for this APN with the received APN rate control   If the UE receives an additional APN rate control parameters for exception data container in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value and use the stored additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data related to the APN indicated in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message in  additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value for this APN, the UE shall replace the stored additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value for this APN with the received additional APN rate control parameters for exception data value.   Protocol configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the small data rate control parameters value and use the stored small data rate control parameters value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink user data for the corresponding PDU session that becomes transferred after inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in   If the UE receives an additional small data rate control parameters for exception data container in the Protocol configuration options IE or the Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall store the additional small data rate control parameters for exception data value and use the stored additional small data rate control parameters for exception data value as the maximum allowed limit of uplink exception data for the corresponding PDU session that becomes transferred after inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in accordance with 3GPPTS201.  If the UE receives non-IP Link MTU parameter, Ethernet Frame Payload MTU parameter, IPv4 Link MTU parameter, or Unstructured Link MTU parameter of the Protocol configuration options IE or of the Extended protocol configuration options IE in the ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall pass the received Non-IP Link MTU size, Ethernet Frame Payload MTU size, or IPv4 Link MTU size, or Unstructured Link MTU size to the upper layer.  NOTE1: The Non-IP Link MTU and the IPv4 Link MTU size correspond to the maximum length of user data that can be sent either in the user data container in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message or via SU interface.  NOTE2: The Ethernet frame payload MTU size corresponds to the maximum  user data container in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message or via SU    session of "Unstructured" PDU session type, thus the UE can request the unstructured link MTU parameter in the default EPS bearer context activation procedure.
 The unstructured link MTU size correspond to the maximum length of user data packet that can be sent either via the  "Unstructured" PDU session type as specified in 3GPPTS201.

 If the network receives the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REJECT message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity", the MME locally deactivates the EPS bearer context(s) without peer-to-peer ESM signalling.
 When the MME detects that after the failed  bearer configuration and the EPS bearer context configuration or between the QoS on NAS and AS level, the MME should initiate the necessary    Abnormal cases in the UE  Apart from the case described in clause, the following abnormal cases can be identified:  a) Collision of UE requested bearer resource modification procedure and EPS bearer context modification procedure:   the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, the Procedure transaction identity IE of the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is set to "No procedure transaction identity assigned" and the EPS bearer indicated in the MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is the EPS bearer that the UE had requested to modify, the UE shall abort internally the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure, and:   if the UE had initiated resource release for all the traffic flows for the bearer and the UE still needs to release the bearer (e.

 The network shall proceed with the EPS bearer modification procedure as if no BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message was received from the UE.   EPS bearer context deactivation procedure 
  The purpose of the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is to  deactivating all EPS bearer contexts to the PDN.
 The EPS bearer context deactivation procedure is initiated by the network, and it may be triggered by the UE by means of the UE requested bearer resource modification procedure or UE requested PDN disconnect procedure.  In the case of EPS bearer context deactivation with reactivation  the MME follows the procedures for re-establishing the NAS signalling connection and deactivating the EPS bearer contexts to the PDN with reactivation requested, as specified in 3GPPTS201 clauses and and 3GPPTS280 clause   CSG subscription expires or is removed, the MME shall deactivate all non-emergency EPS bearers if any.
 The MME shall not deactivate the     REQUEST message to the UE for all bearers that are not allocated for    EPS bearer context deactivation initiated by the network   bearer context deactivation procedure, the MME shall initiate the EPS  CONTEXT REQUEST message to the UE, start the timer T3495, and enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE PENDING (see example in figure). The DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains an ESM cause typically indicating one of the following:  #8: operator determined barring;    #29: user authentication or authorization failed;        #112: APN restriction value incompatible with active EPS bearer context;      modification procedure or UE requested PDN disconnect procedure, the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message shall contain the procedure transaction identity (PTI) value received by the MME in the BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST or PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST    connection and thus disconnect the UE from the PDN, the MME shall include the EPS bearer identity of the default bearer associated to the PDN in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.
 In this case, the MME shall not include the WLAN offload indication in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, and if the UE receives the WLAN offload indication, the UE shall ignore the indication.  NOTE1: If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message contains the UAS services not allowed indication in the Extended protocol configuration options IE, then the ESM cause value #29 "user authentication or authorization failed" is included in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message.  If no NAS signalling connection exists when the MME initiates the EPS bearer context deactivation, the ESM entity in the MME shall locally deactivate the EPS bearer context towards the UE without any peer-to-peer ESM signalling between the MME and the UE.  NOTE2: The EPS bearer context state(s) can be synchronized between the UE and the MME at the next EMM-IDLE to EMM-CONNECTED transition, e.
g.      EPS bearer context deactivation procedure   EPS bearer context deactivation accepted by the UE  Upon receipt of the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message, the UE shall delete the EPS bearer context identified by the EPS bearer identity.
 After deactivating the identified EPS bearer context, the UE shall respond to the MME with the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT.  If the EPS bearer identity indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER  delete all EPS bearer contexts associated to the PDN.
 After deactivating all EPS bearer contexts, the UE shall respond to the MME with the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT.  Upon sending the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT ACCEPT message, the UE shall enter the state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE.
 If due to the EPS bearer context deactivation only the PDN connection for emergency bearer services remains established, the UE shall consider itself attached for emergency bearer services only.  If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST includes ESM cause#39  bearer context, and the UE provided an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection, the UE shall stop timer T3396 if it is running for the APN provided by the UE.
 The UE should then re-initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for the same APN as the deactivated default EPS bearer context to reactivate the EPS bearer context.
 If the UE did not provide an APN for the establishment of the PDN connection and the request type was different from "emergency" and from "handover of emergency bearer services", the UE shall stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running, and should re-initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure without including an APN.
 Additionally, the UE should re-initiate the request(s) for dedicated bearer resources that  this EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.
 If the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message was received for an emergency PDN connection, the UE shall not stop the timer T3396 associated with no APN if it is running.
 The UE should then re-initiate the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for the emergency PDN connection.  NOTE1: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer context(s) automatically.

   Abnormal cases in the UE  The following abnormal case can be identified:     If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, and the UE determines that the EPS bearer indicated in the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is the default EPS bearer of the last PDN connection that the UE has, then the UE shall respond by    If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the UE and the MME, the UE shall proceed with the deactivation procedure as specified   NOTE: User interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-activate the EPS bearer(s), if any, automatically.   Abnormal cases on the network side  The following abnormal cases can be identified:  a) Expiry of timer T3495:  On the first expiry of the timer T3495, the MME shall resend the DEACTIVATE EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T349 This retransmission is repeated four times, i.

 In this case, choosing which EPS bearer context to deactivate is implementation specific.
 The UE shall then include the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA   Upon the inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, for any PDN connection that has been transferred, if the PDN connection is  decides to enable the transfer of the PDN connection from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE may first initiate the UE requested PDN disconnection procedure and then the UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for such PDN connection(s).
 As an implementation option, the UE may deactivate all EPS bearer contexts for such PDN connection(s) locally, and if the last PDN connection is not deactivated or the UE supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, the UE shall include the EPS bearer context status IE in the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message of the tracking area updating procedure upon inter-system change from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode, and then initiate UE requested PDN connectivity procedure for such PDN connection(s).

 Additionally, in all cases with the exception of the UE having received ESM cause #49 "last PDN disconnection not allowed" if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the UE or the MME, the UE shall deactivate all EPS bearer contexts for this PDN connection locally without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME.
 If the UE receives ESM cause #49 "last PDN disconnection not allowed" and the UE has any other PDN connections established, the UE may locally deactivate, without peer-to-peer signalling between the UE and the MME, all EPS bearer contexts associated with those other PDN connections.   Abnormal cases in the UE  The following abnormal cases can be identified:  a) Expiry of timer T3492:  On the first expiry of the timer T3492, the UE shall resend the PDN DISCONNECT REQUEST and shall reset and restart timer T349 This retransmission is repeated four times, i.

 The way to achieve this is implementation dependent.
 While the PTI value is not released, the UE regards any received ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST or MODIFY EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message with the same PTI value as a network retransmission (see clause).  If the ACTIVATE DEDICATED EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message is received, the UE shall verify that the EPS bearer identity given in the EPS bearer identity IE is not already used by any EPS bearer context.

 Furthermore, the network shall perform an EPS bearer context deactivation request procedure to deactivate the dedicated EPS bearer context(s) for which it has deleted the packet filters.  In case 2, if one or more old packet filters belong to the default EPS bearer context, the network shall release the relevant PDN connection using the EPS bearer context deactivation procedure.

The further actions to be performed by the UE are implementation dependent as part of upper layers responsibility.  If the timer T3396 is running when the UE enters state EMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3396 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped.  If the UE is switched off when the timer T3396 is running, and if the USIM in the UE remains the same when the UE is switched on, the UE    let t1 be the time remaining for T3396 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on.

If the Back-off timer value IE is not included, then the UE shall ignore the Re-attempt indicator IE provided by the network, if any.  1) Additionally, if the ESM cause value is #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the UE shall proceed as follows:   EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present), the UE shall behave as described above in the present clause, using the configured SM_RetryWaitTime value as specified in 3GPPTS268[15A] or in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in 3GPPTS302, if available, as back-off timer value; and  NOTE0: The way to choose one of the configured SM_RetryWaitTime values for back-off timer value is up to UE implementation if the UE is   an SM_RetryWaitTime value in ME as specified in 3GPPTS268[15A];   an SM_RetryWaitTime value in USIM file NAS_(CONFIG) as specified in    within the EHPLMN list (if the EHPLMN list is present) or the SM_RetryWaitTime value is not configured, the UE shall behave as described above in the present clause, using the default value of 12 minutes for the back-off timer.  2) For ESM cause values different from #32 "service option not supported", or #33 "requested service option not subscribed", the UE     the bearer resource modification procedure and PLMN and APN combination    NOTE1: This means the back-off timer can still be running or be deactivated for the given ESM procedure and PLMN and APN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change back from A/Gb or Iu mode or N1 mode to S1 mode.
 Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REQUEST message with exception of those identified in clause, in the PLMN for the same APN.  If the back-off timer is started upon receipt of BEARER RESOURCE MODIFICATION REJECT (i.

ESM information request procedure 
  The ESM information request procedure is used by the network to retrieve ESM information, i.

 The purpose of this procedure is to provide privacy for the ESM information if ciphering is enabled in the network.   ESM information request initiated by the network  The network initiates the ESM information request procedure by sending an ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message to the UE, starting timer T3489 and entering the state PROCEDURE TRANSACTION PENDING (see example in figure).
 This message shall be sent only after the security context has been setup, and if the ESM information transfer flag has been set in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.
 The MME shall set the EPS bearer identity of the ESM INFORMATION REQUEST message to the value "no EPS bearer identity assigned" and include the PTI from the associated PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.

 on the third expiry of timer T3493, the UE shall abort the procedure and release any resources for   NOTE: After the abortion of the Remote UE Report procedure, the Remote UE Report procedure for the remote UE(s) can be restarted and how to restart the procedure is left to UE implementation.   Abnormal cases on the network side  The following abnormal cases can be identified:  a) Unknown EPS bearer context:  If the EPS bearer identity provided in the REMOTE UE REPORT message indicates an EPS bearer identity value which does not belong to any already activated EPS bearer context, the MME shall reply with the ESM STATUS message with ESM cause #43 "invalid EPS bearer identity".   Transport of user data via the control plane procedure 
  The purpose of the transport of user data via the control plane procedure is to transfer user data via the control plane in an encapsulated form between the UE and the MME.  The procedure may be initiated by the UE or the network when the UE is   The procedure may also be initiated by the UE in EMM-IDLE mode by     UE initiated transport of user data via the control plane   if the UE is in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE initiates the procedure by sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message including the user data to be sent in the User data container IE (see example in figure). The length of the value part of the User data container IE should not exceed the link MTU size for the respective type of user data (IPv4, IPv6 or Non-IP).
 If the user data in the value part of the User data container IE is an Ethernet frame, then the length of the Ethernet frame payload should not exceed the Ethernet frame payload MTU size.  NOTE: The recommended maximum size for link MTU is 1358 octets to prevent fragmentation in the backbone network (see 3GPPTS260).  larger than 1358 octets could lead to inefficient core network implementation due to fragmentation.  If the UE is in EMM-IDLE mode, the UE initiates the procedure by sending    Based on information provided by the upper layers, the UE may include a Release assistance indication IE in the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message to inform the network that  1) subsequent to the current uplink data transmission no further uplink or downlink data transmission (e.
g.
 an acknowledgement or response) is expected; i.
e.
 the upper layers indicated that data exchanges have completed with the current UL data transfer; or   downlink data transmission and no further uplink data transmission is expected; i.
e.
 the upper layers indicated that data exchanges will have completed with the next downlink data transmission.  When receiving the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message, the MME shall identify the PDN connection to the SCEF or to the PDN GW, based on the EPS bearer identity included in message, and forward the contents of the User data container IE accordingly.
 If the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message includes a Release assistance indication IE, then ESM layer indicates to the EMM layer to initiate release of the NAS signalling connection,  1) if the release assistance indication indicates that no further uplink and no further downlink data transmission subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected; or  2) upon subsequent delivery of the next received downlink data transmission to the UE if the release assistance indication indicates  transmission subsequent to the uplink data transmission is expected.     UE initiated transport of user data via the control    Network initiated transport of user data via the control plane  The network initiates the procedure by sending the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message (see example in figure).
 Upon receiving the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message, the UE shall:   forward the contents of the User data container IE to the upper      Network initiated transport of user data via the    Abnormal cases in the UE  The following abnormal case can be identified:    The UE shall not send an ESM DATA TRANSPORT message unless     the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message is used for an exception data reporting and the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPPTS268[15A] or the USIM file EF_(NASCONFIG) in   The ESM DATA TRANSPORT message can be sent, if still necessary, when timer T3396 expires or is stopped.  b) Transmission failure of the ESM DATA TRANSPORT message indication    TAI list, the transport of user data via the control plane procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated after successfully performing a tracking area updating procedure if the control plane CIoT EPS optimisation is still used and the user data exists.

NOTE: How the ESM sublayer handles the retransmission of user data via the control plane is up to the UE implementation.  c) NAS MAC calculation indication from lower layers  If lower layers indicate to calculate an NAS MAC, the UE shall calculate an NAS MAC as specified in 3GPPTS301 and then provide the calculated NAS MAC and 5 least significant bits of the uplink NAS COUNT used to calculate the NAS MAC to lower layers (see 3GPPTS331). The UE shall increase the uplink NAS COUNT by one after the calculation of the NAS MAC.   Abnormal cases on the network side   where the PLMN is not allowed to operate   allowed to operate, the MME discards the message.   Reception of an ESM STATUS message by an ESM entity  The purpose of the sending of the ESM STATUS message is to report at any time certain error conditions detected upon receipt of ESM protocol data.
 The ESM STATUS message can be sent by both the MME and the UE (see   If the ESM entity of the UE receives an ESM STATUS message the UE shall take different actions depending on the received ESM cause value:  #43 (Invalid EPS bearer identity);  The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received EPS bearer identity, stop any related timer, and deactivate the corresponding EPS bearer context locally (without peer to peer signalling between the UE and the MME).  #81 (Invalid PTI value);  The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received PTI value and stop any related timer.  #97 (Message type non-existent or not implemented);  The UE shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the PTI or EPS bearer identity and stop any related timer.  On receipt of an ESM STATUS message with any other ESM cause value no state transition and no specific action shall be taken as seen from the radio interface, i.
e.
 local actions are possible.  If the ESM entity of the MME receives an ESM STATUS message the MME shall take different actions depending on the received ESM cause value:  #43 (Invalid EPS bearer identity);  The MME shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received EPS bearer identity, stop any related timer, and deactivate the corresponding EPS bearer context locally (without peer to peer signalling between the MME and the UE).  #81 (Invalid PTI value);  The MME shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the received PTI value and stop any related timer.  #97 (Message type non-existent or not implemented);  The MME shall abort any ongoing ESM procedure related to the PTI or EPS bearer identity and stop any related timer.  The local actions to be taken by the MME on receipt of an ESM STATUS message with any other ESM cause value are implementation dependent.      7 Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data 
  The procedures specified in the present document apply to those messages which pass the checks described in this clause.  This clause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity.
 These procedures are called "error handling procedures", but in addition to providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocols.  Clauses to shall be applied in order of precedence.  Most error handling procedures are mandatory for the UE.  Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent and may vary from PLMN to PLMN.
 However, when extensions of this protocol are developed, networks will be assumed to have the error handling that is indicated in this clause as mandatory ("shall") and that is indicated as strongly recommended ("should").  Also, the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not   For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see      message type information element, that message shall be ignored, cf.

  This clause defines the structure of the messages of the Layer3 (L3) protocols defined in the present document.
 These are standard L3 messages as defined in 3GPPTS207.  Each definition given in the present clause includes:  a) a brief description of the message direction and use, including whether the message has:   Local significance, i.
e.
 relevant only on the originating or    Access significance, i.
e.
 relevant in the originating and terminating access, but not in the network;   Dual significance, i.
e.
 relevant in either the originating or terminating access and in the network; or   Global significance, i.
e.
 relevant in the originating and terminating access and in the network.  b) a table listing the Information Elements (IE) known in the message and the order of their appearance in the message.
 All IEs that may be  which compose the imperative part of the message, occur before the T, TV, TLV and TLV-E formatted IEs which compose the non-imperative part of the message, see 3GPPTS207).
 In a (maximal) sequence of consecutive IEs with half octet length, the first IE with half octet   always has an even number of elements.  For each information element the table indicates:   The Information Element Identifier (IEI), in hexadecimal notation, if   digit followed by a "-" (example: B-).  NOTE: The same IEI can be used for different information element types in different messages of the same protocol.   The name of the information element (which may give an idea of the semantics of the element).
 The name of the information element followed by "IE" or "information element" is used in this technical report as    The name of the type of the information element (which indicates the coding of the value part of the IE), and generally, the referenced clause of clause9 of the present document describing the value part of       TLV-E) as defined in 3GPPTS207.   The length of the information element (or permissible range of lengths), in octets, in the message, where "?" means that the maximum length of the IE is only constrained by link layer protocol.
 This   c) clauses specifying, where appropriate, conditions for IEs with  other conditions specified in the present document define when the information elements shall be included or not, what non-presence of such IEs means, and – for IEs with presence requirement C – the static conditions for presence or non-presence of the IEs or for both cases    EPS mobility management messages      This message is sent by the network to the UE to indicate that the corresponding attach request has been accepted.

1 Causes related to UE identification  Cause #2 – IMSI unknown in HSS  This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the UE is not known (registered) in the HSS or if the UE has packet only subscription.
 This EMM cause does not affect operation of the EPS service, although it may be used by an   Cause #3 – Illegal UE  This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network refuses service to the UE either because an identity of the UE is not acceptable to the network or because the UE does not pass the authentication check, i.
e.
 the RES received from the UE is different from that generated by the network.  Cause #6 – Illegal ME  This EMM cause is sent to the UE if the ME used is not acceptable to the network, e.
g.
 on the prohibited list.  Cause #9 – UE identity cannot be derived by the network.  This EMM cause is sent to the UE when the network cannot derive the UE's identity from the GUTI/S-TMSI/P-TMSI and RAI e.
g.
 no matching identity/context in the network or failure to validate the UE's identity due to integrity check failure of the received message.  Cause #10 – Implicitly detached  This EMM cause is sent to the UE either if the network has implicitly detached the UE, e.
g.
 after the implicit detach timer has expired, or if the EMM context data related to the subscription does not exist in the    A.

Annex E (informative): Guidelines for enhancements to MS network capability IE and UE network capability IE  The UE uses the information elements MS network capability and UE network capability to inform the core network about its network related capabilities.
 Both information elements can be signalled in any of the modes: A/Gb mode, Iu mode and S1 mode.  The purpose of the present annex is to give some guidelines how to select the information element(s) to be enhanced if new capabilities need to be added.   supporting A/Gb mode only or Iu mode only or both, the capability will be signalled in the MS network capability IE.   supporting S1 mode only, the capability will be signalled in the UE    network supporting both S1 mode and at least one of the two modes A/Gb mode and Iu mode, the capability is added only to one of the two   a) If the information is used by the MME only, the capability will be signalled in the UE network capability IE.  b) If the information is used by the SGSN only or both by the SGSN and by the MME, the capability will be signalled in the MS network    and Iu mode will not provide the MS network capability IE to the network  capability IE.
 In some cases, due to rules 1 and 2 the capability indicator will be included in both information elements.  EXAMPLE1: The support indicator for UCS2 is included in both   EXAMPLE2: The "SRVCC to GERAN/UTRAN capability" is included in the MS network capability IE, as it is used both by the MME for SRVCC from E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN and by the SGSN for SRVCC from UTRAN HSPA to    Annex F (normative): Application specific Congestion control for Data Communication (ACDC)  The UE may support the procedures in this annex.  If the UE supports ACDC, the EMM layer shall determine the ACDC category applicable to the request based on the application identifier received from the upper layers and the configuration information in the "ACDCConf" leaf of ACDC MO as specified in 3GPPTS205 or in the USIM EF_(ACDC) as specified in 3GPPTS302.  NOTE1: As an implementation option, the upper layers can determine the ACDC category and send it to the EMM layer.
 Then the EMM layer need not read the ACDC MO or USIM to determine the ACDC category.  The EMM sublayer shall indicate to the lower layers, for the purpose of    the ACDC category that applies to this request if only one ACDC    the highest ranked ACDC category among the ACDC categories that applies to this request if multiple ACDC categories are applicable; or   this request is for an uncategorized application if an application identifier received from the upper layers is not mapped to any ACDC   except for the following cases:     the UE is answering to paging;   the RRC Establishment cause is set to "Emergency call"; or   if conditions MO MMTEL voice call is started or MO MMTEL video call is started or MO SMSoIP is started, is satisfied.      If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM layer shall keep track of the ACDC category for which access is barred  ACDC category until access is granted.  If the UE supports ACDC and access is barred because of ACDC, the EMM     Annex G (informative): Change history   --------- -------- ----------- ------ ----- --------------------------------------- -------- --------
