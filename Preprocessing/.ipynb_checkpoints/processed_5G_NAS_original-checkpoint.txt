The present document specifies the non-access stratum (NAS) procedures in the 5G system (5GS) used by the protocols for: mobility management between the user equipment (UE) and the access and mobility management function (AMF) for both 3GPP access and non-3GPP session management between the user equipment (UE) and the session management function (SMF) for both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. The 5GS mobility management (5GMM) protocol defined in the present document provides procedures for the control of mobility when the user equipment (UE) is using the NG radio access network (NG-RAN), non-3GPP access network, or both.
The 5GMM protocol also provides control of security for the NAS protocols. The 5GS session management (5GSM) protocol defined in the present document provides procedures for the handling of 5GS PDU sessions. Together with the bearer control provided by the access stratum, this protocol is used for the control of user-plane resources. For both NAS protocols the present document specifies procedures for the support of inter-system mobility between the NG-RAN and the evolved universal terrestrial radio access (E-UTRAN), between the NG-RAN and the non-3GPP access network connected to the EPC, and between the non-3GPP access network connected to the 5G core network (5GCN) and the E-UTRAN. For both NAS protocols the present document specifies procedures for the support of mobility between the NG-RAN and the non-3GPP access network connected to the 5GCN. In addition, the present document specifies the procedures in the 5GS for UE policy delivery service between the UE and the policy control function (PCF) for both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. The present document is applicable to the UE, the access and mobility management function (AMF), the session management function (SMF), and the PCF in the 5GS. The clauses and subclauses in the present document are common for both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access unless it is explicitly stated that they apply to 3GPP access only or non-3GPP access only..

The non-access stratum (NAS) described in the present document forms the highest stratum of the control plane between UE and AMF (reference point "N1" see 3GPPTS201) for both 3GPP and non-3GPP access. Main functions of the protocols that are part of the NAS are: support of mobility of the user equipment (UE) including also common procedures such as authentication, identification, generic UE configuration update and security mode control procedures; support of session management procedures to establish and maintain data connectivity between the UE and the data network; and UPP-CMI container, UE policy container, SOR transparent container and UE parameters update information payload. Principles for the handing of 5GS security contexts and for the connection is established, are provided in subclause For the support of the above functions, the following procedures are supplied within this specification: elementary procedures for 5GS mobility management in clause5; and elementary procedures for 5GS session management in clause Signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are described as part of the 5GMM common procedures in subclause Complete NAS transactions consist of specific sequences of elementary procedures.
Examples of such specific sequences can be found in The NAS for 5GS follows the protocol architecture model for layer3 as Coordination between the protocols for 5GS mobility management and 5GS session management A 5GS session management (5GSM) message is piggybacked in specific 5GS mobility management (5GMM) transport messages.
To this purpose, the 5GSM messages can be transmitted in an information element in the 5GMM transport messages.
In this case, the UE, the AMF and the SMF execute the 5GMM procedure and the 5GSM procedure in parallel.
The success of the 5GMM procedure is not dependent on the success of the piggybacked The UE can only initiate the 5GSM procedure when there is a 5GMM context established at the UE. During 5GMM procedures, the UE and the AMF shall suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages, except when: a) the 5GMM procedure is piggybacking 5GSM messages; or re-establishing user-plane resources of PDU session(s) is initiated without including PDU session status IE or Allowed PDU session status IE.
In this case, the UE and the AMF need not suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages related to other PDU session(s) than the one(s) for which the user- plane resources re-establishment is requested. If the UE determines to locally release the N1 NAS signalling connection procedure as specified in 3GPP specification document Annex C.
2, the UE shall suspend the transmission of 5GSM messages after sending the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message and until the N1 NAS signalling connection is released case when the UE has an emergency PDU session. delivered via the access associated with the PDU session, if any, with conditions specified in subclause or subclause are message to the 5GSM message described in a) via either: 1) 3GPP access; or 2) non-3GPP access if the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP NOTE: The interaction between the 5GMM sublayer and the 5GSM sublayer to enable the UE to send the UL NAS TRANSPORT message containing the response message via 3GPP access is required.
This is achieved via UE c) the UE shall send, via the target access, an UL NAS TRANSPORT message "existing PDU session" or "existing emergency PDU session" for handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. request message associated with an MA PDU session, shall be delivered via the same access that the initial message was received. The UE's usage setting defined in 3GPPTS201 applies to voice capable UEs in 5GS and indicates whether the UE has preference for voice services over data services or vice-versa, where: a) voice services include IMS voice; and The UE's usage setting can be set to: a) "voice centric"; or the UE which applies to both 5GS and EPS. Domain selection for UE originating sessions / calls The behaviour of the UE for domain selection is determined by: a) the UE usage setting; b) the availability of IMS voice; and c) whether the UE operates in single-registration mode or dual-registration mode (see 3GPPTS201). In the present document the condition "the UE supports IMS voice over 3GPP access" evaluates to "true" if at least one of the following is 1) the UE supports IMS voice over NR connected to 5GCN; 2) the UE supports IMS voice over E-UTRA connected to 5GCN; or 3) the UE supports IMS voice in EPS. In the present document the condition "the UE does not support IMS voice over 3GPP access" evaluates to "true" if the condition "the UE supports IMS voice over 3GPP access" evaluates to "false". In the present document the condition "the UE supports IMS voice over non-3GPP access" evaluates to "true" if the UE supports IMS voice over non-3GPP access connected to 5GCN. In the present document the condition "the UE does not support IMS voice over non-3GPP access" evaluates to "true" if the condition "the UE supports IMS voice over non-3GPP access" evaluates to "false". In the present document, "IMS voice not available" is determined per access type independently, i.
3GPP access or non-3GPP access. In the present document, "IMS voice not available" refers to one of the a) the UE does not support IMS voice; b) the UE supports IMS voice, but the network indicates in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message that IMS voice over PS sessions are not c) the UE supports IMS voice, the network indicates in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message that IMS voice over PS sessions are supported, but the 1) provide no indication that the UE is available for voice call in the 2) indicate that the UE is not available for voice calls in the IMS. time to attempt IMS registration.
In the event an indication from the upper layers that the UE is available for voice calls in the IMS takes longer than the manufacturer determined period of time (e.

Other conditions may exist but these are implementation specific. In the present document, "IMS voice available" applies when "IMS voice not available" does not apply. When IMS voice is not available over 3GPP access, if the UE's usage setting is "voice centric", the UE operates in single-registration mode, 1) if the UE is only registered over 3GPP access, or if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and IMS voice is not available over non-3GPP access, the UE shall disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and proceed as specified in subclause with modifications described below; or 2) if the UE is registered over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and IMS voice is available over non-3GPP access, the UE may disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access and proceed as specified in subclause with modifications described below; or bearer associated with the persistent PDU session has been released.

This clause describes the principles for the handling of 5G NAS security contexts in the UE and in the AMF, the procedures used for the security protection of NAS messages between the UE and the AMF, and the procedures used for the protection of NAS IEs between the UE and the UDM.
Security protection involves integrity protection and ciphering of the 5GMM messages.
5GSM messages are security protected indirectly by being piggybacked by the security protected 5GMM messages (i.
UL NAS TRANSPORT message and the DL NAS TRANSPORT message). The signalling procedures for the control of NAS security are part of the 5GMM protocol and are described in detail in clause subclause, for the ease of description, it is assumed that ciphering is without ciphering is achieved by configuring the AMF so that it always selects the "null ciphering algorithm", 5G-EA Handling of 5G NAS security contexts.
Establishment of 5G NAS security context The security parameters for authentication, integrity protection and ciphering are tied together in a 5G NAS security context and identified parameters is defined in 3GPPTS301. Before security can be activated, the AMF and the UE need to establish a 5G NAS security context.
Usually, the 5G NAS security context is created between the AMF and the UE.
A new 5G NAS security context may also be created during an N1 mode to N1 mode handover.
Alternatively, during inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the AMF not supporting interworking without N26 and the UE operating in single-registration context that has been established while the UE was in S1 mode. The 5G NAS security context is taken into use by the UE and the AMF, mode to N1 mode handover, or during the inter-system change procedure from S1 mode to N1 mode.
The 5G NAS security context which has been taken into use by the network most recently is called current 5G NAS security context.
This current 5G NAS security context can be of type or mapped 5G NAS security context. The key set identifier ngKSI is assigned by the AMF either during the primary authentication and key agreement procedure or, for the mapped 5G NAS security context, during the inter-system change.
The ngKSI consists NAS security context, the ngKSI has the value of KSI_(AMF), and when the current 5G NAS security context is of type mapped, the ngKSI has the The 5G NAS security context which is indicated by an ngKSI can be taken authentication and key agreement procedure (see subclause) or when the initial NAS messages (i.
REGISTRATION REQUEST, DEREGISTRATION REQUEST, SERVICE REQUEST and CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST) and the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message contain an ngKSI in the ngKSI IE indicating the current 5G NAS security context used to integrity protect In the present document, when the UE is required to delete an ngKSI, the UE shall set the ngKSI to the value "no key is available" and consider also the associated keys K_(AMF) or K'_(AMF), 5G NAS ciphering key and 5G NAS integrity key invalid (i.
the 5G NAS security context associated with the ngKSI as no longer valid).
In the initial registration procedure, when the key K_(AUSF,) is invalid, the UE shall NOTE: In some specifications the term ciphering key sequence number might be used instead of the term key set identifier (KSI). As described in subclause in order to interwork with E-UTRAN connected to EPC, the UE supporting both S1 mode and N1 mode can operate in either single-registration mode or dual-registration mode.
A UE operating in dual-registration mode shall independently maintain and use both EPS security context (see 3GPPTS201) and 5G NAS security context.
When the UE operating in dual-registration mode performs an EPS attach procedure, it shall take into use an EPS security context and follow the handling of this security context as specified in 3GPPTS201.
However, when the UE operating in dual-registration mode performs an initial registration procedure, it shall take into use a 5G NAS security context and follow the handling of this security context as described in the present specification. The UE and the AMF need to be able to maintain two 5G NAS security contexts simultaneously, i.
a current 5G NAS security context and a non-current 5G NAS security context, since: a) after a 5G re-authentication, the UE and the AMF can have both a context which has not yet been taken into use (i.
a partial native 5G NAS security context); and b) after an inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE and the The number of 5G NAS security contexts that need to be maintained simultaneously by the UE and the AMF is limited by the following partial native 5G NAS security context, the AMF and the UE shall delete the non-current 5G NAS security context, if any; previously current 5G NAS security context.
If the UE does not support multiple records of NAS security context storage for multiple registration (see 3GPPTS302), the UE shall delete the previously current 5G NAS security context.
If the UE supports multiple records of NAS security context storage for multiple registration, the 1) replace the previously current 5G NAS security context stored in the first 5G security context of that access (see 3GPPTS302) with control procedure), when the UE activates the new 5G security context for the same PLMN and access; or 2) store the previously current 5G NAS security context in the second 5G security context of that access (see 3GPPTS302) and store the procedure) in the first 5G security context, when the UE activates the previously current 5G NAS security context is associated with the 5G-GUTI of the other access; c) when the AMF and the UE create a 5G NAS security context using "null integrity protection algorithm" and "null ciphering algorithm" during an has an emergency PDU session (see subclause), the AMF and the UE shall delete the previous current 5G NAS security context.
The UE shall not update the USIM and non-volatile ME memory with the current 5G NAS security context and shall delete the current 5G NAS security context when the UE is deregistered from emergency services (e.
before registering for normal service); created using "null integrity protection algorithm" and "null ciphering algorithm" is taken into use during the inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the AMF and the UE shall not delete the previously current native 5G NAS security context, if any.
Instead, the previously current security context, and the AMF and the UE shall delete any partial native 5G NAS security context; If no previously current native 5G NAS security context exists, the AMF and the UE shall not delete the partial native 5G NAS security context, during inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the AMF and the UE shall delete any existing current mapped 5G NAS security context; delete the previously current mapped 5G NAS security context; g) when the UE or the AMF moves from 5GMM-REGISTERED to 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state, if the current 5G NAS security context is a security context exists, then the non-current 5G NAS security context shall become the current 5G NAS security context.
Furthermore, the UE and the AMF shall delete any mapped 5G NAS security context or partial native 5G NAS security context. supporting N26 interface performs an inter-system change from N1 mode to change is performed in: i) 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE shall delete the mapped 5G NAS security context after the successful completion of the tracking area update procedure or attach procedure (see 3GPPTS201); or ii) 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the UE shall delete the mapped 5G NAS security context after the completion of the inter-system change. After deletion of the mapped 5G NAS security context, if the UE has a non-current full native 5G NAS security context, then the non-current full native 5G NAS security context shall become the current full native 5G NAS security context; and supporting N26 interface performs an inter-system change from S1 mode to NAS security context, then the UE shall make the non-current full native 5G NAS security context as the current native 5G NAS security context. The UE shall delete the mapped 5G NAS security context, if any. UE leaving state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall mark the 5G NAS security context on the USIM or in the non-volatile memory as invalid when the UE initiates an initial registration procedure as described in subclause or when the UE leaves state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED for any other state except 5GMM-NULL. If the UE is capable of registration over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and was last registered on the same PLMN over both 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access, the UE in the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access shall mark the 5G NAS security contexts in record 1 of the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access on the USIM or in the non-volatile memory as invalid when the UE initiates an initial registration procedure over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access as described in subclause or when the UE leaves state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED for any other state except 5GMM-NULL over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access. UE entering state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED shall store the current native 5G NAS security context on the USIM or in the non-volatile memory and mark it as valid only when the UE enters state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED from any other state except 5GMM-NULL or when the UE aborts the initial registration procedure without having left If the UE is capable of registration over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and is registered on the same PLMN over both 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access, the UE shall store the current native 5G NAS security contexts of the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access as specified in annexC and mark them as valid only when the UE enters state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED from any other state except 5GMM-NULL over both the 3GPP access and non-3GPP access or only when the UE aborts the initial registration procedure without having left 5GMM-DEREGISTERED over both the 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. an inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, security context received from the source MME as indicated in 3GPPTS301.
The AMF shall select the 5G NAS security algorithms shall define an ngKSI for the newly derived K'_(AMF) key such that the value field is taken from the eKSI of the K_(ASME) key and the type ngKSI with the newly created mapped 5G NAS security context.
The AMF shall then include the message authentication code, selected NAS algorithms, NCC and generated ngKSI in the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE (see subclause). supporting N26 interface receives the command to perform inter-system K'_(AMF,) as indicated in 3GPPTS301, using the K_(ASME) from the EPS security context.
Furthermore, the UE shall also derive the 5G NAS keys from the mapped K'_(AMF) using the selected NAS algorithm identifiers included in the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE and associate this mapped 5G NAS security context with the ngKSI value received.
The UE shall then verify the received NAS MAC.
In case the received NAS MAC is not verified successfully (see subclause ) the UE shall discard the content of the received S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE and inform the lower layers that the received S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container is invalid. services and has no current EPS security context, the AMF shall set 5G-IA0 and 5G-EA0 as the selected 5G NAS security algorithms in the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE.
The AMF shall create a locally generated K'_(AMF).
The AMF shall set the ngKSI value of the associated security context to "000" and the type of security context flag to "mapped security context" in the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS supporting N26 interface receives the command to perform inter-system change to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode (see 3GPPTS331) and as the selected 5G NAS security algorithms are included in the S1 mode generated K'_(AMF).
Furthermore, the UE shall set the ngKSI value of the associated security context to the KSI value received. After the new mapped 5G NAS security context is taken into use for the N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode and the UE is registered with the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and non-3GPP access: 1) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access, then the AMF and the UE shall activate and take into use the new mapped 5G NAS security context on the 3GPP access for the non-3GPP access as described in 3GPPTS301 after the AMF sends or the UE receives the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message respectively.
The UE and AMF shall keep the native 5G NAS security context which was used on the non-3GPP access and native 5G NAS security context may be re-activated later using the security mode control procedure; or 2) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access, in order to activate the native 5G NAS security context over the 3GPP access that is active on the non-3GPP access the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the 3GPP access as described in 3GPPTS301.
The SECURITY MODE COMMAND message shall include the same ngKSI to identify the native 5G NAS security context that is used on the non-3GPP access; or 1) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access, the AMF and the UE shall activate and take into use the new mapped 5G NAS security context active on the 3GPP access for the non-3GPP access as described in 3GPPTS301 after the AMF sends or the UE receives the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message respectively; or 2) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access, in order to activate the same mapped 5G NAS security context over one access that is used on the other access the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over one-access as described in 3GPPTS301.
The SECURITY MODE COMMAND message shall include the same ngKSI to identify the mapped 5G NAS security context that is used over the other access. If the inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode is not completed successfully, the AMF and the UE operating in delete the new mapped 5G NAS security context. Establishment of a 5G NAS security context during N1 mode to N1 mode handover security context as indicated in 3GPPTS301. the target AMF includes the 8 least significant bits of the downlink NAS COUNT in the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE, and indicates AMF shall increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one after creating the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE. target AMF includes the 8 least significant bits of the downlink NAS COUNT in the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE and indicates shall then set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this 5G NAS security context to zero.
The AMF shall increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one after creating the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent The target AMF also includes the ngKSI with the same value as the ngKSI currently being used with the UE, the message authentication code, and the selected NAS algorithms in the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent an Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE (see subclause), 3GPPTS301.

If the received Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE does not have a valid NAS COUNT (see subclause) or the received NAS MAC is not verified successfully (see subclause) the UE shall discard the content of the received Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE, continue to use the current 5G NAS security context, and inform the lower layers that the received Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container NOTE1: During N1 mode to N1 mode handover, the Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE (see subclause) is equivalent to K_(AMF).
The UE maintains the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms until After the new 5G NAS security context is taken into use for 3GPP access registered with the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and non-3GPP access: a) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access, the AMF and the UE shall activate and take into use the new 5G NAS security context over the non-3GPP access as described in 3GPPTS301 after the AMF sends or the UE receives the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message respectively. AMF and the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to zero also for the non-3GPP access, otherwise the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT for the non-3GPP access are not changed; or b) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access, in order to activate the new 5G NAS security context over the non-3GPP access that has been activated for the 3GPP access the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message over the non-3GPP access as described in 3GPPTS301.
The SECURITY MODE COMMAND message shall include the same ngKSI to identify the new 5G NAS security context that was activated over the 3GPP access and shall include the horizontal derivation parameter indicating "K_(AMF) derivation is not required". K_(AMF), the AMF and the UE shall set the downlink NAS COUNT and uplink NAS COUNT to zero for the non-3GPP access. NOTE2: Explicit indication "K_(AMF) derivation is not required" for the non-3GPP access is to align security contexts within the UE without a Establishment of an EPS security context during inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the NAS COUNT of the current 5G NAS security context, include the corresponding NAS sequence number in the N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container IE (see subclause) and then increments its stored downlink NAS COUNT value by one. NOTE: The creation of the N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container and the increment of the stored downlink NAS COUNT value by one are performed in prior to transferring the mapped EPS security context to The AMF shall select the NAS algorithms identifiers to be used in the target MME after the inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, for encryption and integrity protection.
The uplink and downlink NAS COUNT associated with the newly derived K'_(ASME) key are set to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT value of the current 5G NAS security context, respectively.

The UE shall set the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values associated with the newly derived K'_(ASME) key to the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT values of the current 5G NAS security context respectively.
The eKSI for the newly derived K'_(ASME) key is defined such that the value field is taken from context.
The UE shall also derive the NAS keys as specified in 3GPPTS301[23A] using the EPS NAS security algorithms identifiers that are stored in the UE's 5G NAS security context. If the received N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container IE does not content of the received N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container IE and inform the lower layers that the received N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container is invalid. If the inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode is not completed successfully, the AMF and the UE shall delete the new mapped EPS security context. Establishment of secure exchange of NAS messages usually established by the AMF during the registration procedure by completion of the security mode control procedure, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected using the current 5G security algorithms, and except for the messages specified in subclause, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent ciphered using the current 5G security algorithms. During inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, secure exchange of NAS messages is established between the AMF and a) the transmission of NAS security related parameters encapsulated in the AS signalling from the AMF to the UE triggering the inter-system change in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode (see 3GPPTS301).
The UE uses these parameters to generate the mapped 5G NAS security context (see subclause of 3GPPTS301); and b) after the inter-system change in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the The UE shall send this message integrity protected using the mapped 5G NAS security context and further protect this message as specified in subclause and subclause After the AMF receives the 1) if the AMF decides to take the native 5G NAS security context into use, the security mode control procedure is performed.
From this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected using the native 5G NAS security context, and except for the messages specified in subclause, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent ciphered using the native 5G NAS security context; or 2) if the AMF decides to take the mapped 5G NAS security context into use, from this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected using the mapped 5G NAS security context, and except for the messages specified in subclause, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent ciphered using the mapped 5G NAS security context. During inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-IDLE mode, if the UE is operating in single-registration mode and: native 5G NAS security context.
The UE shall include the ngKSI indicating the native 5G NAS security context value in the REGISTRATION After receiving the REGISTRATION REQUEST message including the ngKSI whether the ngKSI included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message belongs to a 5G NAS security context available in the AMF, and shall verify the MAC of the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the verification is successful, the AMF deletes the EPS security context received from the source MME if any, and the AMF re-establishes the secure exchange of NAS protected and ciphered using the native 5G NAS security context.
From this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in subclause, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent ciphered; or the current 5G NAS security context by selecting new NAS security b) if the UE has no valid native 5G NAS security context, the UE shall send the REGISTRATION REQUEST message without integrity protection and After receiving the REGISTRATION REQUEST message without integrity 1) if N26 interface is supported: i) if an EPS security context received from the source MME does not include the NAS security algorithms set to EIA0 and EEA0, the AMF shall NAS security context; or ii) if an EPS security context received from the source MME includes the NAS security algorithms set to EIA0 and EEA0, the AMF shall trigger a native 5G NAS security context; or authentication and key agreement procedure. The newly created 5G NAS security context is taken into use by the current 5G NAS security context in both the UE and the AMF.
This re-establishes the secure exchange of NAS messages. During an N1 mode to N1 mode handover, secure exchange of NAS messages is established between the AMF and the UE by: the transmission of NAS security related parameters encapsulated in the AS signalling from the target AMF to the UE triggering the N1 mode to N1 mode handover (see 3GPPTS301).
The UE uses these The secure exchange of NAS messages shall be continued after N1 mode to N1 mode handover.
It is terminated after inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or when the NAS signalling the initial NAS message integrity protected with the current 5G NAS security context and further protect this message as specified in subclause The UE shall include the ngKSI indicating the current 5G NAS security context value in the initial NAS message.
The AMF shall check whether the ngKSI included in the initial NAS message belongs to a 5G NAS security context available in the AMF, and shall verify the MAC of the NAS message.
If the verification is successful, the AMF may re-establish the secure exchange of NAS messages: ciphered using the current 5G NAS security context.
From this time onward, all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent integrity protected and except for the messages specified in subclause , all NAS messages exchanged between the UE and the AMF are sent modify the current 5G NAS security context by selecting new NAS security serving network, both the AMF and the UE shall follow the behavior specified in subclause of 3GPPTS301.
The UE may support multiple records of NAS security context storage for multiple registration (see 3GPPTS302).
If the UE supports multiple records of NAS security context storage for multiple registration, the UE can select the appropriate one among the stored 5G security contexts to protect the initial NAS message (see 3GPPTS301). NOTE: For the case when the UE has two records of NAS security context stored and is attempting registration to the PLMN associated with the 5G-GUTI (or an equivalent PLMN) for that access, the UE uses the first NAS security context of that access to protect the initial NAS message. For the case when the UE has two records of NAS security context stored and is attempting registration to the PLMN associated with the second record (or an equivalent PLMN) of that access, the UE uses the second NAS security context of that access to protect the initial NAS message. For other cases when the UE has two records of NAS security context with any NAS security context record, the UE uses either record of the NAS security context of that access to protect the initial NAS message. Change of security keys security context, the messages exchanged during the authentication procedure are integrity protected and ciphered using the current 5G NAS security context, if any. Both UE and AMF shall continue to use the current 5G NAS security SECURITY MODE COMMAND message sent by the AMF includes the ngKSI of the new 5G NAS security context to be used.
The AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message integrity protected with the new 5G NAS security COMPLETE message, it shall send the message integrity protected and ciphered with the new 5G NAS security context. The AMF can also modify the current 5G NAS security context or take the non-current native 5G NAS security context, if any, into use, by sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message including the ngKSI of the 5G NAS security algorithms.
In this case the AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message integrity protected with the modified 5G NAS security COMPLETE message, it shall send the message integrity protected and ciphered with the modified 5G NAS security context. Handling of NAS COUNT and NAS sequence number.
Each 5G NAS security context shall be associated with two separate counters NAS COUNT per access type in the same PLMN: one related to uplink NAS messages and one related to downlink NAS messages.
If the 5G NAS security context is used for access via both 3GPP and non-3GPP access in the same PLMN, there are two NAS COUNT counter pairs associated with the 5G NAS security context.
The NAS COUNT counters use 2bit internal representation and are independently maintained by UE When NAS COUNT is input to NAS ciphering or NAS integrity algorithms it shall be considered to be a 3bit entity which shall be constructed by padding the 2bit internal representation with 8 zeros in the most The value of the uplink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or non-volatile memory as described in annexC, is the value that shall be used in the next NAS message. The value of the downlink NAS COUNT that is stored or read out of the USIM or non-volatile memory as described in annexC, is the largest The value of the uplink NAS COUNT stored in the AMF is the largest The value of the downlink NAS COUNT stored in the AMF is the value that shall be used in the next NAS message. The NAS sequence number part of the NAS COUNT shall be exchanged between the UE and the AMF as part of the NAS signalling.
After each new or retransmitted outbound SECURITY PROTECTED 5GS NAS MESSAGE message, the sender shall increase the NAS COUNT number by one, except for the initial NAS messages if the lower layers indicated the failure to establish the RRC connection (see 3GPPTS331).
Specifically, on the sender side, the NAS sequence number shall be increased by one, and if the result is zero (due to wrap around), the stored NAS overflow counter shall also be incremented by one (see subclause).
If, through implementation-dependent means, the receiver determines that the handles the received NAS message as described in subclause Otherwise, in order to determine the estimated NAS COUNT value to be The sequence number part of the estimated NAS COUNT value shall be equal to the sequence number in the received NAS message; and If the receiver can guarantee that this NAS message was not previously accepted, then the receiver may select the estimated NAS overflow counter so that the estimated NAS COUNT value is lower than the stored NAS COUNT value; otherwise, the receiver selects the estimated NAS overflow counter so that the estimated NAS COUNT value is higher than the stored NAS COUNT value. During the inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED use, the AMF shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this 5G NAS security context to zero.
The UE shall set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this 5G NAS security context During the inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the AMF shall increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one after it has created an S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container (see During the inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the AMF shall increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one after it has created an N1 mode to S1 mode NAS transparent container (see During N1 mode to N1 mode handover: a) if the new 5G NAS security context is created with the same K_(AMF), the AMF shall signal the 8 least significant bits of the current downlink NAS COUNT value in an Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container (see subclause).
The AMF shall then increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one; or AMF shall signal the 8 least significant bits of the current downlink NAS COUNT value in an Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container (see subclause) and shall then set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters of this 5G NAS security context to zero.
The AMF shall then increment the downlink NAS COUNT by one.
The UE shall also set both the uplink and downlink NAS COUNT counters to zero. NOTE: During the inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container (see subclause) is treated as an implicit SECURITY MODE COMMAND message for the UE and the AMF, and therefore the AMF regards the sending of the S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container as the sending of an initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message in order to derive the NAS COUNT handling. Replay protection shall be supported for received NAS messages both in the AMF and the UE.
However, since the realization of replay protection does not affect the interoperability between nodes, no specific mechanism is required for implementation. Replay protection assures that one and the same NAS message is not time and only if message integrity verifies correctly. Replay protection is not applicable when 5G-IA0 is used. Integrity protection and verification The sender shall use its locally stored NAS COUNT as input to the The receiver shall use the NAS sequence number included in the received message and an estimate for the NAS overflow counter as defined in subclause to form the NAS COUNT input to the integrity The algorithm to calculate the integrity protection information is specified in 3GPPTS301, and in case of the: a) SECURITY PROTECTED 5GS NAS MESSAGE message, the integrity protection b) Intra N1 mode NAS transparent container IE and S1 mode to N1 mode NAS transparent container IE, the integrity protection shall include all octets of the value part of the IE starting from octet NOTE: To ensure backward compatibility, the UE uses all octets starting from octet 7 in the received NAS transparent container for the purpose of integrity check of the NAS transparent container irrespective of the can ignore the octets which are not specified in the release/version which the UE supports. In addition to the data that is to be integrity protected, the BEARER ID, DIRECTION bit, NAS COUNT and 5G NAS integrity key are input to the integrity protection algorithm.
These parameters are described in After successful integrity protection validation, the receiver shall update its corresponding locally stored NAS COUNT with the value of the estimated NAS COUNT for this NAS message. Integrity verification is not applicable when 5G-IA0 is used. The sender shall use its locally stored NAS COUNT as input to the The receiver shall use the NAS sequence number included in the received message and an estimate for the NAS overflow counter as defined in subclause to form the NAS COUNT input to the deciphering The input parameters to the NAS ciphering algorithm are the BEARER ID, DIRECTION bit, NAS COUNT, NAS encryption key and the length of the key stream to be generated by the encryption algorithm. When applying initial NAS message protection to the REGISTRATION REQUEST, DEREGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message as described in subclause, the length of the key stream is set to the length of the entire plain NAS message that is included in the NAS message container IE, i.
the value part of the NAS message container IE, that is to be ciphered. When applying initial NAS message protection to the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message as described in subclause, the length of the key stream is set to the length of: a) the value part of the CIoT small data container IE that is to be b) the value part of the NAS message container IE that is to be NAS COUNT wrap around If, when increasing the NAS COUNT as specified above, the AMF detects that either its downlink NAS COUNT or the UE's uplink NAS COUNT is "close" to wrap around, (close to 2²⁴), the AMF shall take the following If there is no non-current native 5G NAS security context with established 5G NAS security context and the NAS COUNT being reset to 0 in both the UE and the AMF when the new 5G NAS security context is authentication and key agreement procedure as specified above. authentication and key agreement procedure before the NAS COUNT wraps instead release the NAS signalling connection.
Prior to sending the next uplink NAS message, the UE shall delete the ngKSI indicating the current 5G NAS security context. When the 5G-IA0 is used as the NAS integrity algorithm, the UE and the AMF shall allow NAS COUNT wrap around.
If NAS COUNT wrap around occurs, the following requirements apply: a) the UE and the AMF shall continue to use the current 5G NAS security b) the AMF shall not initiate the primary authentication and key c) the AMF shall not release the NAS signalling connection; and Integrity protection of NAS signalling messages.
For the UE, integrity protected signalling is mandatory for the 5GMM NAS into use.
For the network, integrity protected signalling is mandatory been established for the NAS signalling connection.
Integrity protection of all NAS signalling messages is the responsibility of the NAS.
It is the network which activates integrity protection. The use of "null integrity protection algorithm" 5G-IA0 (see subclause4) in the current 5G NAS security context is only a) for an unauthenticated UE for which establishment of emergency d) for a 5G-RG acting on behalf of an AUN3 device. For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages, the UE and the AMF shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether the "null integrity protection algorithm" or any other integrity protection algorithm is indicated in the 5G NAS security context. If the "null integrity protection algorithm"5G-IA0 has been selected as an integrity protection algorithm, the receiver shall regard the NAS messages with the security header indicating integrity protection as Details of the integrity protection and verification of NAS signalling messages are specified in 3GPPTS301. protected, the NAS message is first ciphered and then the ciphered NAS message and the NAS sequence number are integrity protected by NOTE: NAS messages that are ciphered with the "null ciphering algorithm" 5G-EA0 are regarded as ciphered (see subclause). unciphered, the unciphered NAS message and the NAS sequence number are integrity protected by calculating the MAC. When a 5GSM message is piggybacked in a 5GMM message, there is only one Sequence number IE and one Message authentication code IE for the 5GMM message piggybacking the 5GSM message. Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the UE Except the messages listed below, no NAS signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving 5GMM entity in the UE or forwarded to the 5GSM entity, unless the network has established secure exchange of 5GS NAS messages for the NAS signalling connection: a) IDENTITY REQUEST (if requested identification parameter is SUCI); e) REGISTRATION REJECT (if the 5GMM cause is not #76, #78, #81 or #82); f) DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT (for non switch off); and g) SERVICE REJECT (if the 5GMM cause is not #76 or #78). NOTE: These messages are accepted by the UE without integrity protection, as in certain situations they are sent by the network before security can be activated. Integrity protection is never applied directly to 5GSM messages, but to the 5GMM message in which the 5GSM message is included. Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established, the receiving 5GMM entity in the UE shall not process any NAS signalling messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the NAS.
If NAS signalling messages, having not successfully passed the integrity check, are received, then the NAS in the UE shall discard that message.
The processing of the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message that has not successfully passed the integrity check is specified in subclause If any NAS signalling message is received as not integrity protected even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established by the network, then the NAS shall discard this Integrity checking of NAS signalling messages in the AMF Except the messages listed below, no NAS signalling messages shall be processed by the receiving 5GMM entity in the AMF or forwarded to the 5GSM entity, unless the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection: b) IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is SUCI); e) SECURITY MODE REJECT; f) DEREGISTRATION REQUEST; and NOTE1: The REGISTRATION REQUEST message is sent by the UE without integrity protection, if the registration procedure is initiated due to an inter-system change in 5GMM-IDLE mode and no current 5G NAS security context is available in the UE.
The other messages are accepted by the AMF without integrity protection, as in certain situations they are sent by the UE before security can be activated. NOTE2: The DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message can be sent by the UE without integrity protection, e.
if the UE is registered for emergency services and there is no valid 5G NAS security context available, or if secure exchange of NAS messages has been established.
For these cases the network can attempt to use additional criteria (e.
whether the UE is subsequently still performing periodic registration update or still responding to paging) before marking the UE as 5GMM-DEREGISTERED. Integrity protection is never applied directly to 5GSM messages, but to the 5GMM message in which the 5GSM message is included. of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection, the receiving 5GMM entity in the AMF shall process the following NAS signalling messages, even if the MAC included in the message fails the integrity check or cannot be verified, as the 5G NAS security context is not available in the network: b) IDENTITY RESPONSE (if requested identification parameter is SUCI); e) SECURITY MODE REJECT; h) SERVICE REQUEST; and i) CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST; NOTE3: These messages are processed by the AMF even when the MAC that fails the integrity check or cannot be verified, as in certain situations they can be sent by the UE protected with a 5G NAS security context that is no longer available in the network. services, the AMF shall authenticate the subscriber before processing the registration request any further.
Additionally, the AMF shall 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to "Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message as specified in subclause If authentication procedure is not successful the AMF shall maintain, if any, the 5GMM-context and 5G NAS security context unchanged.
For the case when the registration procedure is for emergency services see subclause and update fails the integrity check and the UE provided EPS NAS message container IE which was successfully verified by the source MME, the AMF control procedure to take the new mapped 5G NAS security context into and include the Additional 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to "Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message as specified in subclause If authentication procedure is not successful the AMF shall maintain, if any, the 5GMM-context and 5G NAS security context unchanged.
For the case when the UE has an emergency PDU session see subclause shall proceed as follows: can initiate an authentication procedure, the AMF should authenticate the subscriber before processing the deregistration request any further. not initiate an authentication procedure for any other reason, the AMF may ignore the deregistration request and remain in state NOTE4: The network can attempt to use additional criteria (e.
whether the UE is subsequently still performing periodic registration update or still responding to paging) before marking the UE as 5GMM-DEREGISTERED. integrity check and the UE has only non-emergency PDU sessions established, the AMF shall send the SERVICE REJECT message with 5GMM cause #9 "UE identity cannot be derived by the network" and keep the 5GMM-context and 5G NAS security context unchanged.
For the case when the UE has an emergency PDU session and integrity check fails, the AMF may skip the authentication procedure even if no 5G NAS security context is available and proceed directly to the execution of the security mode control procedure as specified in subclause Additionally, the AMF shall include the Additional 5G security information IE with the RINMR bit set to "Retransmission of the initial NAS message requested" in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message as specified in subclause After successful completion of the service request procedure, the network emergency PDU session shall not be released. Once the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for the NAS signalling connection, the receiving 5GMM entity in the AMF shall not process any NAS signalling messages unless they have been successfully integrity checked by the NAS.
If any NAS signalling message, having not successfully passed the integrity check, is received, then the NAS in the AMF shall discard that message.
If any NAS signalling message is received, as not integrity protected even though the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established, then the NAS shall discard this message. Ciphering of NAS signalling messages configuration.
When operation of the network without ciphering is configured, the AMF shall indicate the use of "null ciphering algorithm" 5G-EA0 (see subclause4) in the current 5G NAS security context for all UEs.
For setting the security header type in outbound NAS messages, the UE and the AMF shall apply the same rules irrespective of whether the "null ciphering algorithm" or any other ciphering algorithm is indicated in the 5G NAS security context. apply security protection to the initial NAS message as described in The UE shall start the ciphering and deciphering of NAS messages when the secure exchange of NAS messages has been established for an N1 NAS signalling connection.
From this time onward, unless explicitly defined, the UE shall send all NAS messages ciphered until the N1 NAS signalling connection is released, or the UE performs inter-system change to S1 The AMF shall start ciphering and deciphering of NAS messages as described in subclause From this time onward, except for the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, the AMF shall send all NAS messages ciphered until the N1 NAS signalling connection is released, or the UE performs inter-system change to S1 mode. Ciphering is never applied directly to 5GSM messages, but to the 5GMM message in which the 5GSM message is included. Once the encryption of NAS messages has been started between the AMF and the UE, the receiver shall discard the unciphered NAS messages which shall have been ciphered according to the rules described in this If the "null ciphering algorithm" 5G-EA0 has been selected as a ciphering algorithm, the NAS messages with the security header indicating ciphering are regarded as ciphered. Details of ciphering and deciphering of NAS signalling messages are Protection of initial NAS signalling messages The 5GS supports protection of initial NAS messages as specified in 3GPPTS301.
The protection of initial NAS messages applies to the REGISTRATION REQUEST, DEREGISTRATION REQUEST, SERVICE REQUEST and CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message, and is achieved as follows: a REGISTRATION REQUEST message including cleartext IEs only.
After 1) if the UE needs to send non-cleartext IEs, the UE shall include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message (i.
containing both cleartext IEs and non-cleartext IEs) in the NAS message container IE and shall include the NAS message container IE in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message; or 2) if the UE does not need to send non-cleartext IEs, the UE shall include the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST message (i.
containing cleartext IEs only) in the NAS message container IE and shall include the NAS message container IE in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message. DEREGISTRATION REQUEST, or SERVICE REQUEST message, the UE includes the entire REGISTRATION REQUEST, DEREGISTRATION REQUEST or SERVICE REQUEST message (i.
containing both cleartext IEs and non-cleartext IEs) in the NAS message container IE and shall cipher the value part of the NAS DEREGISTRATION REQUEST, or SERVICE REQUEST message containing the cleartext IEs and the NAS message container IE; i) if CIoT small data container IE is the only non-cleartext IE to be sent, the UE shall cipher the value part of the CIoT small data message containing the cleartext IEs and the CIoT small data container ii) otherwise, the UE includes non-cleartext IEs in the NAS message container IE and shall cipher the value part of the NAS message message containing the cleartext IEs and the NAS message container IE; REQUEST, DEREGISTRATION REQUEST, or SERVICE REQUEST message, the UE sends the REGISTRATION REQUEST, DEREGISTRATION REQUEST, or SERVICE REQUEST message without including the NAS message container IE; or SERVICE REQUEST message, the UE sends the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message without including the NAS message container IE and the CIoT small data container IE. Registration request message identity; EPS NAS message container; PLMN with disaster condition. De-registration request message identity; Service request message identity; the cleartext IEs are: Control plane service request message identity; and Control plane service type. SERVICE REQUEST or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message that includes a NAS message container IE, the UE shall set the security header type of the initial NAS message to "integrity protected". When the AMF receives an integrity protected initial NAS message which part of the NAS message container IE.
If the received initial NAS REQUEST message, the AMF shall consider the NAS message that is obtained from the NAS message container IE as the initial NAS message that value part of the CIoT small data container IE and handle the message as the UE shall send an initial NAS message including cleartext IEs only via the access type associated with the newly selected PLMN as described and the Registered PLMN or EPLMN is not registering or registered over the UE shall delete the 5G NAS security context. NOTE: UE deletes the 5G NAS security context only if the UE is not in Protection of NAS IEs The network can provide the SOR transparent container IE during the registration procedure to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
The SOR transparent container IE is integrity protected by the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN as specified in 3GPPTS301. The UE can provide the SOR transparent container IE during the registration procedure to the network in the REGISTRATION COMPLETE message.
The SoR-MAC-I_(UE) in the SOR transparent container IE is generated by the UE as specified in 3GPPTS301. The network can provide the Payload container IE during the Network-initiated NAS transport procedure to the UE in DL NAS TRANSPORT message.
If the Payload container type IE is set to "SOR transparent container" or "UE parameters update transparent container", the Payload container IE is integrity protected by the HPLMN or subscribed SNPN as specified in 3GPPTS301.
If the Payload container type IE is set to "Multiple payloads" and the payload container type field of the payload container entry is set to "SOR transparent container" or "UE parameters update transparent container", the payload container entry contents field of the payload container entry is integrity protected The UE can provide the Payload container IE during the UE-initiated NAS transport procedure to the network in UL NAS TRANSPORT message.
If the Payload container type IE is set to "SOR transparent container" or "UE parameters update transparent container", the SoR-MAC-I_(UE) or UPU-MAC-I_(UE) in the Payload container IE is generated by the UE as specified in 3GPPTS301.
If the Payload container type IE is set to "Multiple payloads" and the payload container type field of the payload container entry is set to "SOR transparent container" or "UE parameters update transparent container", the SoR-MAC-I_(UE) or UPU-MAC-I_(UE) in the payload container entry contents field of the payload container entry is generated by the UE correspondingly..
When the UE needs to access the 5GS, the UE not operating as an IAB-node (see 3GPPTS201), not acting as a 5G ProSe layer-2 UE-to-network relay UE (see 3GPPTS204[6E]) whose access attempt is triggered by a 5G ProSe layer-2 remote UE, and not acting as an NCR-MT node (see 3GPPTS300), first performs access control checks to determine if the access is allowed.
Access control checks shall be performed for the access attempts defined by the following list of events: NOTE1: Although the UE operating as an IAB-node or as an NCR-MT node skips the access control checks, the UE operating as an IAB-node or as an NCR-MT node determines an access category and one or more access identities for each access attempt in order to derive an RRC establishment cause.
In this case the NAS provides the RRC establishment cause but does not provide the access category and the one or more access identities to the lower layers. NOTE1A: Although the UE acting as a 5G ProSe layer-2 UE-to-network relay UE skips the access control checks, the UE determines an access category and one or more access identities for each access attempt in order to derive an RRC establishment cause. a) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication 5GMM-CONNECTED mode occurs; and b) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication and one of the following events 1) 5GMM receives an MO-IMS-registration-related-signalling-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-voice-call-started indication, an MO-MMTEL-video-call-started indication or an MO-SMSoIP-attempt-started indication from upper layers; transition the UE from 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode; message for the purpose of PDU session establishment unless the request 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication to message for the purpose of PDU session modification unless the request 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication to an existing PDU session; 6) 5GMM is notified that an uplink user data packet is to be sent for a PDU session with suspended user-plane resources; procedure to transition the UE from 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-IDLE mode with suspend indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode; signalling transaction towards the PCF by sending an UL NAS TRANSPORT procedure to transition the UE from 5GMM-IDLE mode to 5GMM-CONNECTED 9) 5GMM receives an indication from lower layers of the RAN timing synchronization status change, and decides to transition the UE from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode as specified in subclause NOTE2: 5GMM specific procedures initiated by NAS in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication are not subject to access control, e.
a registration procedure after PS handover will not be prevented by access control (see subclause). NOTE3: LPP messages, SLPP messages, or location event report messages terminating or network induced location request, and the corresponding access attempts are handled as MT access. the UDM by sending an UL NAS TRANSPORT message including an SOR transparent container is not supported.
Therefore, access control for these cases has not been specified. When the NAS detects one of the above events, the NAS needs to perform the mapping of the kind of request to one or more access identities and one access category and lower layers will perform access barring checks for that request based on the determined access identities and access NOTE5: The NAS is aware of the above events through indications provided by upper layers or through determining the need to start 5GMM procedures through normal NAS behaviour, or both. To determine the access identities and the access category for a request, the NAS checks the reason for access, types of service requested and profile of the UE including UE configurations, against a set of access identities and access categories defined in a) a set of standardized access identities; b) a set of standardized access categories; and c) a set of operator-defined access categories, if available. For the purpose of determining the applicable access identities from the set of standardized access identities defined in 3GPPTS261, the NAS shall follow the requirements set out in: a) subclause and the rules and actions defined in table, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP b) subclauseA and the rules and actions defined in tableA.
1, if the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access. In order to enable access barring checks for access attempts identified by lower layers in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication, the UE provides the applicable access identities to lower layers. NOTE6: When and how the NAS provides the applicable access identities to lower layers is UE implementation specific. NOTE7: Although the UE operating as an IAB-node or as an NCR-MT node skips the access control checks, the UE provides the applicable access identities to lower layers for access attempts identified by lower layers in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication. For the purpose of determining the applicable access category from the set of standardized access categories and operator-defined access categories defined in 3GPPTS261, the NAS shall follow the requirements set out in: a) subclause and the rules and actions defined in table, if the UE is not operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP b) subclauseA and the rules and actions defined in tableA.
2, if the UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode over 3GPP access. When the UE needs to initiate an access attempt in one of the events listed in subclause, the UE shall determine one or more access identities from the set of standardized access identities, and one access category from the set of standardized access categories and operator-defined access categories, to be associated with that access The set of the access identities applicable for the request is determined by the UE in the following way: table, the UE shall check whether the access identity is if it is applicable in the RPLMN or equivalent PLMN; and b) if none of the above access identities is applicable, then access identity 0 is applicable..
0 UE is not configured with any parameters from this 1 (NOTE 1) UE is configured for multimedia priority service 2 (NOTE 2) UE is configured for mission critical service 0 Reserved for future use 11 (NOTE 3) Access Class 11 is configured in the UE.
12 (NOTE 3) Access Class 12 is configured in the UE.
13 (NOTE 3) Access Class 13 is configured in the UE.
14 (NOTE 3) Access Class 14 is configured in the UE.
15 (NOTE 3) Access Class 15 is configured in the UE.
The UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE or the Priority indicator IE to determine if access identity 1 is valid. Processing of the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is described in subclause and subclause Processing of the MPS indicator bit of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message is described in subclause The UE shall not consider access identity 1 to be valid when the UE is neither in the country of its HPLMN nor in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), until the UE receives the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message being set to "Access identity 1 valid" from the RPLMN or from an equivalent PLMN. When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), the contents of the USIM file EF_(UAC_AIC) as specified in 3GPPTS302 and the rules specified in table are used to determine the applicability of access identity When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), and the USIM file EF_(UAC_AIC) does not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 1, the UE uses the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or of the Priority indicator IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to determine if access identity 1 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), and the USIM file EF_(UAC_AIC) indicates the UE is configured for access identity 1, the MPS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE and the Priority indicator IE are not applicable.
When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), the contents of the USIM file EF_(UAC_AIC) are not applicable. The UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE to determine if access identity 2 is valid.
Processing of the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message is described in subclause and subclause The UE shall not consider access identity 2 to be valid when the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present) prior to receiving the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message being set to "Access identity 2 valid". When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), the contents of the USIM file EF_(UAC_AIC) as specified in 3GPPTS302 and the rules specified in table are used to determine the applicability of access identity When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), and the USIM file EF_(UAC_AIC) does not indicate the UE is configured for access identity 2, the UE uses the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to determine if access identity 2 is valid.
When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), and the USIM file EF_(UAC_AIC) indicates the UE is configured for access identity 2, the MCS indicator bit of the 5GS network feature support IE is not applicable.
When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), the contents of the USIM file EF_(UAC_AIC) are not applicable. The UE checks the conditions specified in subclause of 3GPPTS222 to determine if access identity 3 is valid, and the applicability of access identity When the UE is in its HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), the contents of the USIM file EF_(ACC) as specified in 3GPPTS302 and the rules specified in table are used to determine the applicability of access classes 11 and 1 When the UE is not in its HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or in an EHPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is present), access classes 11 and 15 are not applicable. When the UE is in the country of its HPLMN, the contents of the USIM file EF_(ACC) as specified in 3GPPTS302 and the rules specified in table are used to determine the applicability of access classes 12 - 1 When the UE is not in the country of its HPLMN, access classes 14 are not applicable. In order to determine the access category applicable for the access attempt, the NAS shall check the rules in table, and use the access attempt matches more than one rule, the access category of the lowest rule number shall be selected.
If the access attempt matches more than one operator-defined access category definition, the UE shall select the access category from the operator-defined access category definition with the lowest precedence value (see subclause). NOTE: The case when an access attempt matches more than one rule includes the case when multiple events trigger an access attempt at the same time.

Exception handling and avoiding double barring Access attempts are allowed to proceed without further access control checking in order to avoid double barring for any service request or registration procedure initiated for the purpose of NAS signalling layers (see subclauses and\). NOTE1: The case of NAS signalling connection recovery also includes the cases where the UE was in S1 mode when the RRC connection failure For any service request or registration procedure of this kind the UE determines an access category as specified in subclause and of the present subclause. NOTE2: Although the access control checking is skipped, the access category is determined for the specific access attempt in order to derive an RRC establishment cause. There are several services or an MO IMS registration related signalling for which the NAS needs to be informed when the service starts and because, while the service is ongoing or the MO IMS registration related signalling is ongoing, the mapping of other access attempts to a specific access category can be affected; and in order to avoid double barring at the start of these services or at the start of the MO IMS registration related signalling. e) SMS over NAS; g) UE-requested policy provisioning procedure for V2XP, ProSeP or both; h) CIoT user data transfer over the control plane. The UE considers an emergency service a) as started when 5GMM receives a request from upper layers to register for emergency services or to or "existing emergency PDU session".
It considers the emergency service as stopped when this PDU session is released. In addition, the UE considers an emergency service a) as started when services fallback and performs emergency services fallback as specified in subclause of 3GPPTS202.
In this case, the UE considers the emergency service as stopped when: the emergency PDU session established during the emergency services fallback is released if the UE has moved to an E-UTRA cell connected to the service request procedure involved in the emergency services fallback is completed otherwise. While an emergency service a) is ongoing, any access attempt triggered procedure or by an uplink user data packet to be sent for an emergency PDU session with suspended user-plane resources is mapped to access category 2 = emergency. Once the emergency service has successfully passed access control, then as long as the service is ongoing, the following access attempts are allowed to proceed without further access control checking in order to any service request procedure related to the PDU session associated with request type = "initial emergency request" or "existing emergency suspended user-plane resources associated with request type = "initial emergency request" or "existing emergency PDU session". NOTE3: Although the access control checking is skipped, the mapping is performed in order to derive an RRC establishment cause. For services b) to h) the 5GMM receives explicit start and stop indications from the upper layers. For the case of handover of ongoing services b) to d) from non-3GPP access, the 5GMM receives an additional explicit handover of ongoing service from non-3GPP access indication from the upper layers. The 5GMM may receive an additional explicit "call-pull-initiated" indication from the upper layers (see 3GPPTS274[13D]). Once the service has successfully passed access control, then as long as the service is ongoing, the following access attempts are allowed to proceed without further access control checking in order to avoid double for services b), c) and d): 1) any service request procedure related to the PDU session established for DNN = "IMS" except between receiving from the lower layers an indication that access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories 0 and 2, or access barring is applicable for all access categories except category 0, and receiving from the lower layers an indication that the barring is alleviated for the access category determined for the access attempt; suspended user-plane resources established for DNN = "IMS" except between receiving from the lower layers an indication that access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories 0 and 2, or access barring is applicable for all access categories except category 0, and receiving from the lower layers an indication that the barring is alleviated for the access category determined for the access 3) any start of the MO IMS registration related signalling; SMSoIP and the indicated DNN used for SMSoIP is different from "IMS": 1) any service request procedure related to the PDU session established for the DNN used for SMSoIP except between receiving from the lower layers an indication that access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories 0 and 2, or access barring is applicable for all access categories except category 0, and receiving from the lower layers an indication that the barring is alleviated for access suspended user-plane resources established for the DNN used for SMSoIP except between receiving from the lower layers an indication that access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories 0 and 2, or access barring is applicable for all access category except category 0, and receiving from the lower layers an indication that the barring is alleviated for access category For the MO IMS registration related signalling, the 5GMM receives explicit start and stop indications from the upper layers.

Inclusion of an SD in an S-NSSAI is optional.
A set of one or more S-NSSAIs is called the NSSAI.
The following S-NSSAIs and NSSAIs are defined in 3GPPTS201: f) alternative S-NSSAIs; and g) partially allowed NSSAI. The following NSSAIs are defined in the present document: a) rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN; b) rejected NSSAI for the current registration area; c) rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA; d) rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached; e) alternative NSSAI; and f) partially rejected NSSAI. In roaming scenarios, rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN, rejected NSSAI for the current registration area, rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, or partially rejected NSSAI includes one S-NSSAI(s).
An S-NSSAI included in the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA is an HPLMN S-NSSAI. a) the configured NSSAI per PLMN; b) NSSRG information if the UE has indicated that it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network c) network slice usage control information if the UE has indicated it supports the network slice usage control feature; d) S-NSSAI time validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports S-NSSAI time validity information; and e) S-NSSAI location validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports S-NSSAI location validity information. configured NSSAI and consider the default configured NSSAI as valid in a NSSAI.
The support for NSSRG information by the UE and the network, NOTE0: The network slice usage control feature is not supported in NOTE1: The value(s) used in the default configured NSSAI are expected to be commonly decided by all roaming partners, e.
, values standardized by 3GPP or other bodies. registering nor registered for onboarding services in SNPN with: a) a configured NSSAI applicable to the SNPN; b) NSSRG information if the UE has indicated that it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network c) S-NSSAI time validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports S-NSSAI time validity information; d) network slice usage control information if the UE has indicated it supports the network slice usage control feature; and e) S-NSSAI location validity information if the UE has indicated that it supports S-NSSAI location validity information. configured NSSAI associated with the selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or the PLMN subscription and consider the default configured NSSAI nor an allowed NSSAI.
If the UE is registering or registered for onboarding services in SNPN, the serving SNPN shall not by the UE and the network, respectively, is optional. The allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area are managed per access type independently, i.
3GPP access or non-3GPP access, and is applicable for the registration area.
If the UE current registration area is applicable to the tracking area on which it was received.
If the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, the allowed NSSAI, the rejected NSSAI for the current registration area, rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA and rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached are applicable to these PLMNs in this registration area. TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, can be used to form the requested NSSAI for any of the equivalent PLMNs when the UE is outside of the registration area where the allowed NSSAI was When the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is to be initiated for one or more S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI or the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is ongoing for one or more S-NSSAIs, these S-NSSAI(s) will be included in the pending NSSAI.
When the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is completed for an NSSAI that has been in the pending NSSAI, the S-NSSAI will be moved to the allowed NSSAI or rejected NSSAI depending on the outcome of the procedure.
The AMF sends the updated allowed NSSAI to the UE over the same access of the requested S-NSSAI.
The AMF sends the updated partially allowed NSSAI to the UE only over the 3GPP access.
The AMF sends the updated rejected NSSAI over either 3GPP access or non-3GPP access.
The pending NSSAI is managed regardless of access type i.
the pending NSSAI is applicable to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access for the current PLMN even if sent over only one of the accesses.
If the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, the pending NSSAI is applicable to these PLMNs in this The rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN is applicable for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN regardless of the access type.
The AMF registration area consists of TAIs that only belong to the registered registration area also contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, the UE shall treat the received rejected NSSAI for the current PLMN as applicable to the whole registered PLMN. The rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA includes one or more S-NSSAIs that have failed the network slice-specific authentication and authorization or for which the authorization have been revoked, and are applicable for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN regardless of the The rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached is applicable for the whole registered PLMN or SNPN, and the access type over which including S-NSSAI(s) with the rejection cause "S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached", when one or more S-NSSAIs are indicated that the maximum number of UEs has been reached.
If the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI(s) was started upon reception of the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, the UE may remove the S-NSSAI(s) from the rejected NSSAI including S-NSSAI(s) with the rejection cause "S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached", if the timer T3526 associated with the S-NSSAI(s) expires.
If one or more S-NSSAIs are removed from the rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached, the timer T3526 associated with the removed S-NSSAI(s) shall be stopped, if running.
The UE shall not stop the timer T3526 if the UE selects an E-UTRA cell connected to EPC. reached, the registration area contains TAIs belonging to different PLMNs, which are equivalent PLMNs, the UE shall treat the received rejected NSSAI for the maximum number of UEs reached as applicable to these equivalent PLMNs when the UE is in this registration area. If the UE has indicated that the UE supports network slice replacement feature and the AMF determines to provide the mapping information between the S-NSSAI to be replaced and the alternative S-NSSAI to the UE, the network shall provide the UE with the alternative NSSAI.
The alternative NSSAI is managed per access type independently, i.
3GPP access or non-3GPP access, and is applicable for the registration area. If the UE has indicated that the UE supports the partial network slice feature and includes the S-NSSAI(s) in the requested NSSAI, the AMF determines the S-NSSAI(s) to be included in the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI as specified in subclause When the AMF provides both the partially allowed NSSAI and the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE, each S-NSSAI shall be either in the partially allowed NSSAI or in the partially rejected NSSAI but not both.
The number of S-NSSAIs included in the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI shall not exceed The number of S-NSSAI stored in the partially allowed NSSAI and the allowed NSSAI shall not exceed The partially allowed NSSAI is only applicable to 3GPP access and is applicable for the registration area.
The partially rejected NSSAI is only applicable to 3GPP access and is applicable for the NOTE2: Based on local policies, the UE can remove an S-NSSAI from the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA when the UE wants to register to the slice identified by this S-NSSAI. NOTE3: Based on network local policy, network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure can be initiated by the AMF for an S-NSSAI in rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA when the S-NSSAI is requested by the UE based on its local policy. NOTE4: At least one S-NSSAI in the default configured NSSAI or at least one default S-NSSAI is recommended as not subject to network slice-specific authentication and authorization, in order to ensure that at least one PDU session can be established to access service, even when Network Slice-specific Authentication and Authorization fails. NOTE5: At least one S-NSSAI in the default configured NSSAI or at least one default S-NSSAI is recommended as not subject to network slice admission control, in order to ensure that at least one PDU session can be established to access service.

In this case the UE indicates to the AMF that the requested NSSAI is created from the default configured NSSAI. In roaming scenarios, if the mapped S-NSSAI(s) associated to the allowed NSSAI or the configured NSSAI are missing, the UE shall locally set the mapped S-NSSAI to the same value as the received S-NSSAI.
Additionally, without associated mapped S-NSSAI(s), and the rejected NSSAI is different from the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA, the UE shall locally set the mapped S-NSSAI(s) to the same value as the NOTE1: The above occurs only when the UE is roaming and the AMF compliant with earlier versions of the specification omits providing to NSSAI or configured NSSAI. Other than S-NSSAIs contained in the NSSAIs described above, the requested NSSAI can be formed based on the S-NSSAI(s) available in the UE (see subclause for further details).
In roaming scenarios, the UE shall also provide the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the requested NSSAI. S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or configured NSSAI, the UE still uses the S-NSSAI as received from the serving network (i.
, without the locally set mapped S-NSSAI) in any NAS message. The AMF verifies if the requested NSSAI is permitted based on the subscribed S-NSSAIs in the UE subscription and, in roaming scenarios the mapped S-NSSAI(s) provided by the UE, and if so then the AMF shall provide the UE with the allowed NSSAI for the PLMN or SNPN, and shall also provide the UE with the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the allowed NSSAI for the PLMN or SNPN.
Additionally, if the AMF allows one or more subscribed S-NSSAIs for the UE, the AMF may include the allowed subscribed S-NSSAI(s) in the allowed NSSAI in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
The AMF shall ensure that there are not two or more S-NSSAIs of the allowed NSSAI which are mapped to the same S-NSSAI of the HPLMN or the a) all the S-NSSAIs included in the requested NSSAI are rejected, or the requested NSSAI was not included by the UE; b) all default S-NSSAIs are not allowed; and c) the UE is neither registering nor registered for onboarding services in SNPN and the UE is neither registering nor registered for emergency then the AMF may reject the registration request (see subclauses and for further details). In roaming scenarios, if the mapped S-NSSAI(s) associated to requested NSSAI are missing, the AMF shall locally set the mapped S-NSSAI to the same value as the received S-NSSAI. NOTE3: In roaming scenarios, when the UE is compliant with earlier versions of the specification or when the serving network does not S-NSSAIs in requested NSSAI. by the network or the UE.
In this case, the allowed NSSAI and associated registration area may be changed during the registration procedure or the generic UE configuration update procedure.
The configured NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI may be changed during the registration procedure or the generic UE configuration update procedure.

The pending NSSAI may be changed during the registration procedure.
In addition, using the generic UE configuration update procedure, the network may trigger the registration procedure in order to update the allowed NSSAI. The UE in NB-N1 mode does not include the requested NSSAI during the registration procedure if the 5GS registration type IE indicates "mobility registration updating", procedure is not initiated to change the slice(s) that the UE is currently registered to, and the UE is still in the current registration area. procedure with the 5GS registration type IE indicating "mobility registration updating" for the UE in NB-N1 mode, except if the allowed NSSAI has changed for the UE.

Network slice-specific authentication and authorization The UE and network may support network slice-specific authentication and A serving PLMN or SNPN shall perform network slice-specific authentication and authorization for the S-NSSAI(s) of the HPLMN or the subscribed SNPN which are subject to it based on subscription information.
The UE shall indicate whether it supports network slice-specific authentication and authorization in the 5GMM Capability IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message as specified in The upper layer stores an association between each S-NSSAI and its corresponding credentials for the network slice-specific authentication NOTE1: The credentials for network slice-specific authentication and authorization and how to provision them in the upper layer are out of the scope of 3GPP. The network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure shall not be performed unless the primary authentication and key agreement procedure as specified in the subclause has successfully The AMF informs the UE about S-NSSAI(s) for which network slice-specific authentication and authorization (except for re-NSSAA) will be performed or is ongoing in the pending NSSAI.
The AMF informs the UE about S-NSSAI(s) for which NSSAA procedure is completed as success in the allowed NSSAI or in the partially allowed NSSAI.
The AMF informs the UE about S-NSSAI(s) for which NSSAA procedure is completed as failure in the rejected NSSAI for the failed or revoked NSSAA.
The AMF stores and handles allowed NSSAI, partially allowed NSSAI, pending NSSAI, rejected NSSAI, and 5GS registration result in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message according to subclauses and NOTE2: The AMF maintains the NSSAA procedure status for each S-NSSAI, as specified in 3GPPTS218[20B] and the NSSAA procedure status for each S-NSSAI is not impacted by NSAC as specified in subclauses NOTE3: Upon completion of NSSAA procedures, it can happen that the total number of S-NSSAIs which need to be included in the allowed NSSAI exceeds eight.
In this case, it is up to the AMF implementation on how to pick up the S-NSSAIs included in the allowed NSSAI. NOTE4: It can happen that one or more S-NSSAIs included in the received allowed NSSAI, are not the S-NSSAIs that the UE intends to register to. In this case, it is up to the UE implementation on how to use these To perform network slice-specific authentication and authorization for an S-NSSAI, the AMF invokes an EAP-based network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure for the S-NSSAI, see subclause and 3GPPTS202 using the EAP framework as The AMF updates the allowed NSSAI, the partially allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause after the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is completed. The AMF shall send the pending NSSAI containing all S-NSSAIs for which the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure (except for re-NSSAA) will be performed or is ongoing in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
The AMF shall also include in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the allowed NSSAI containing one or more S-NSSAIs from the requested NSSAI which are allowed by the AMF and for which network slice-specific authentication and authorization is not required, if any.
The AMF shall also include in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the partially allowed NSSAI containing one or more S-NSSAIs from the current registration area and for which network slice-specific authentication and authorization is not required, if any. The network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization procedure or the network slice-specific authorization revocation time.
After the network performs the network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization procedure or network slice-specific authorization revocation procedure: a) if network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization fails or network slice-specific authorization is revoked for some but not all S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI,, the AMF updates the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI accordingly using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause and inform the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI for which network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization fails or network slice-specific authorization is revoked; b) if network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization fails or network slice-specific authorization is revoked for all S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI but there are one or more default S-NSSAIs which are not subject to network slice-specific authentication and authorization or for which the network slice-specific authentication and authorization has been successfully performed, the AMF updates the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI containing these default S-NSSAIs and the rejected NSSAI accordingly using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause The AMF shall also inform the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI for which network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization fails or network slice-specific authorization is revoked; or c) if network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization fails or network slice-specific authorization is revoked for all S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and all default S-NSSAIs are subject to network slice-specific authentication and authorization, and the network slice-specific authentication and authorization has not been successfully performed for any of these default S-NSSAIs, then AMF performs the network-initiated de-registration procedure and includes the rejected NSSAI in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message as specified in the subclause except when the UE has an emergency PDU session established or the UE is establishing an emergency PDU session.
In this case the AMF shall send the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message containing rejected NSSAI and inform the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI for which network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization fails or network slice-specific authorization is revoked.
After the emergency PDU session is released, the AMF performs the network-initiated de-registration procedure as specified in the The UE does not include in the requested NSSAI any of the S-NSSAIs from the pending NSSAI that the UE stores, regardless of the access type. additional S-NSSAIs not included in the pending NSSAI, the UE initiates S-NSSAIs as described in subclause In this case, the requested NSSAI shall also include one or more S-NSSAIs from the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI, if the UE still wants to use the S-NSSAI(s) from the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI. including one or more S-NSSAIs that were previously requested over the same access type, the AMF considers S-NSSAIs included in the requested NSSAI and S-NSSAIs in the pending NSSAI that were previously requested over the same access type as requested S-NSSAIs by the UE.
The AMF handles the requested S-NSSAIs as described in subclause When performing the network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization procedure if the S-NSSAI is included in the allowed NSSAI for both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, and the UE is registered to both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in the same PLMN, then the AMF selects an access type to perform network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization based upon operator policy. If network slice-specific authorization is revoked for an S-NSSAI that is in the current allowed NSSAI for an access type or for an S-NSSAI that is in the current partially allowed NSSAI for 3GPP access type, the excluding the S-NSSAI for which the network slice-specific authorization including the S-NSSAI for which the network slice-specific authorization is revoked, with the rejection cause "S-NSSAI not available due to the failed or revoked network slice-specific authentication and to the UE using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause and inform the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI for which the network slice-specific authorization is revoked for this access type. performing network slice-specific re-authentication and re-authorization procedure, the AMF may determine to not forward the 5GSM message to the SMF as described in subclause NOTE5: If the AMF receives the HTTP code set to "4xx" or "5xx" as specified in 3GPPTS200[20AA] or the AMF detects that the NSSAAF failure as specified in 3GPPTS226[21A] during the NSSAA procedure for an S-NSSAI, then the AMF considers the NSSAA procedure has failed Mobility management based network slice admission control A serving PLMN or SNPN can perform network slice admission control for the S-NSSAI(s) subject to NSAC to monitor and control the number of registered UEs per network slice.
The timing of the network slice admission control is managed by the EAC mode per network slice, which can be either activated or deactivated for the network performing network slice admission control.
The EAC mode is activated when the If the EAC mode is activated for an S-NSSAI, the AMF performs network slice admission control before the S-NSSAI subject to NSAC is included in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI sent to the UE. mobility registration updating from another AMF), if the AMF determines that the maximum number of UEs has been reached for: a) one or more S-NSSAIs but not all S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI, then the AMF includes the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI accordingly in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message as specified in the subclauses and ; b) all S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI but there are one or more default S-NSSAIs which can be allowed to the UE, then the AMF includes the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI containing these default S-NSSAIs and the rejected NSSAI accordingly in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message as specified in the subclauses and ; or c) all S-NSSAIs in the requested NSSAI and there are no default S-NSSAIs which can be allowed to the UE, then the AMF includes the rejected NSSAI accordingly in the REGISTRATION REJECT message as specified in the If the EAC mode is deactivated for an S-NSSAI, the AMF performs network slice admission control after the S-NSSAI subject to NSAC is included in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI sent to the UE.
While the AMF is waiting for response from the NSACF for the S-NSSAI, the AMF processes the NAS signalling message related to the S-NSSAI as usual i.
like S-NSSAI in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI. After the network performs the network slice admission control, if the AMF determines that the maximum number of UEs has been reached for: a) one or more S-NSSAIs but not all S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI, then the AMF updates the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and the rejected NSSAI accordingly using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the b) for all S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI but there are one or more default S-NSSAIs which can be allowed to the UE, then the AMF updates the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI containing these default S-NSSAIs and the rejected NSSAI accordingly using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause; or c) for all S-NSSAIs in the allowed NSSAI or the partially allowed NSSAI and there are no default S-NSSAIs which can be allowed to the UE, then the AMF performs the network-initiated de-registration procedure and includes the rejected NSSAI in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message as specified in the subclause except when the UE has an emergency PDU session established or the UE is establishing an emergency PDU When the UE has an emergency PDU session established or the UE is establishing an emergency PDU session, the AMF updates the rejected NSSAI using the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in the subclause and informs the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI.
During the generic UE configuration update procedure, the AMF includes the 5GS registration result IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message and sets the Emergency registered bit of the 5GS registration result IE to "Registered for emergency services".
After the emergency PDU session is released, the AMF performs the network-initiated de-registration procedure as specified in the Based on operator policy, the mobility management based network slice admission control is not applicable for the S-NSSAI used for emergency services, or the mobility management based network slice admission control result is ignored for the S-NSSAI used for emergency services. Based on operator policy, the mobility management based network slice admission control is not applicable for the UEs configured for priority services, or the mobility management based network slice admission control result is ignored for the UEs configured for priority services. NOTE: A UE configured for priority services can be identified based on the RRC establishment cause received from the NG-RAN or based on the MPS priority information in the user's subscription context obtained from The mobility management based network slice admission control is not Provision of NSAG information to lower layers The support for NSAG information by the UE and the network, respectively, is optional.
The NSAG information provided by the network a) an NSAG ID; b) a list of S-NSSAI(s), which are associated with the NSAG and shall be part of the configured NSSAI; NOTE0: An alternative S-NSSAI is added to the configured NSSAI if not c) a priority value that is associated with the NSAG; and NOTE1: The AMF can take local configuration, UE 5GMM capabilities, subscribed S-NSSAIs, the mapping information between the S-NSSAI to be replaced and the alternative S-NSSAI, HPLMN, etc.
to determine the NSAG provided by the network, the NSAG is valid in the PLMN or SNPN which has sent the NSAG information and its equivalent PLMN(s). NOTE2: If the NSAG for the PLMN and its equivalent PLMN(s) have TAIs in the NSAG information. The UE NAS layer shall provide the lower layers with: a) the most recent NSAG information stored in the UE (see b) the allowed NSSAI and the partially allowed NSSAI (if any) or the requested NSSAI for the purpose of network slice-based cell reselection c) zero or more S-NSSAIs related to an access attempt for the purpose of network slice-based random access, when the access attempt is made by the UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication, determined as follows: i) requested NSSAI (if any), if an access attempt occurred due to the ii) NSSAI(s) associated with all the PDU sessions included in the Uplink data status IE (if any), PDU session status IE (if any), or Allowed PDU session status IE (if any), if an access attempt occurred due to the SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message; iii) the S-NSSAI associated with the PDU session, if an access attempt associated with an S-NSSAI (if any); or or an UL NAS TRANSPORT message; iv) no S-NSSAI, if an access attempt occurred due to: the UE-initiated NAS transport procedure for sending SMS, LPP message, UPP-CMI container, SLPP message, SOR transparent container, UE policy v) the allowed NSSAI (if any) and the partially allowed NSSAI (if any), if an access attempt occurred for other reason than those specified in bullets i) - iv). Mobility management based network slice replacement optional.
If the UE and network support network slice replacement, and the AMF determines that an S-NSSAI included in the allowed NSSAI needs to be replaced with an alternative S-NSSAI, the AMF provides: a) the alternative S-NSSAI in the allowed NSSAI, if not included yet; b) the alternative S-NSSAI in the configured NSSAI, if not included yet; c) the alternative S-NSSAI in the NSAG information, if not included yet and the UE supports NSAG; and d) the mapping information between the S-NSSAI to be replaced and the to the UE during the UE configuration update procedure or during the registration procedure as follows: a) for non-roaming UE, the AMF provides the mapping information between the S-NSSAI included in the allowed NSSAI and the alternative S-NSSAI to NOTE1: In non-roaming scenarios, the alternative S-NSSAI does not have to be part of the subscribed S-NSSAI(s) in the UE subscription. b) for roaming UE: 1) if the S-NSSAI included in the allowed NSSAI needs to be replaced (i.
the S-NSSAI to be replaced is part of the VPLMN S-NSSAIs), the AMF provides the mapping information between the S-NSSAI included in the allowed NSSAI and the alternative S-NSSAI to the UE; and 2) if the S-NSSAI included in the mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the allowed NSSAI needs to be replaced (i.
the S-NSSAI to be replaced is part of the HPLMN S-NSSAIs), the AMF provides the mapping information between the S-NSSAI and the alternative S-NSSAI to the UE. NOTE1A: In roaming scenarios, the alternative S-NSSAI part of the HPLMN S-NSSAIs does not have to be part of the subscribed S-NSSAI(s) in the UE NOTE2: It is up to AMF local policy to determine when to provide the mapping information between the S-NSSAI to be replaced and the alternative S-NSSAI to the UE, e.
when the alternative S-NSSAI is available and there is no PDU session associated with the S-NSSAI to be replaced, or wait until the UE establishes the first PDU session associated with the S-NSSAI to be replaced. If the AMF determines that the S-NSSAI which has been replaced is available, the AMF provides the updated alternative NSSAI excluding the S-NSSAI which has been replaced and the corresponding alternative S-NSSAI to the UE during the UE configuration update procedure or during If all the S-NSSAI(s) that were replaced in alternative NSSAI are available, the AMF provides the alternative NSSAI with Length of Alternative NSSAI contents set to 0 in the UE configuration update procedure or registration procedure.
The AMF also provides the updated allowed NSSAI and configured NSSAI to the UE. NOTE3: If there is S-NSSAI location validity information for both the S-NSSAI to be replaced and the alternative S-NSSAI, the NS-AoS of the alternative S-NSSAI is the same as or larger than the NS-AoS of the S-NSSAI to be replaced.
If the NS-AoS of the alternative S-NSSAI is larger than the NS-AoS of the S-NSSAI to be replaced, the UE can request the establishment of user plane resources of PDU session(s) associated with the alternative S-NSSAI in the cell(s) outside the NS-AoS of the S-NSSAI to be replaced but within the NS-AoS of the alternative S-NSSAI. Mobility management for optimised handling of temporarily available network slices The UE and the network may support optimised handling of temporarily available network slices.
The support for S-NSSAI time validity information by the UE and the network, respectively, is optional. If the UE has indicated that it supports S-NSSAI time validity information, then the AMF may include the S-NSSAI time validity information for one or more S-NSSAIs included in the configured NSSAI in the Registration Accept message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
If the AMF determines that the S-NSSAI time validity information for an S-NSSAI in the configured NSSAI is changed, the AMF S-NSSAI via the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message. If the UE supporting S-NSSAI time validity information, is configured with S-NSSAI time validity information for an S-NSSAI and: a) the S-NSSAI time validity information indicates that the S-NSSAI is available, then the UE may request the S-NSSAI in the requested NSSAI in the Registration Request message; b) the S-NSSAI time validity information indicates that the S-NSSAI is i) the UE shall not include the S-NSSAI in the requested NSSAI in the ii) the UE shall remove the S-NSSAI from the stored allowed NSSAI (if any) and the stored partially allowed NSSAI (if any) in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as specified in annexC; and iii) the S-NSSAI time validity information indicates that the S-NSSAI will not become available again, then the UE shall remove the S-NSSAI from the stored configured NSSAI in the non-volatile memory in the ME, as specified in annexC. When the S-NSSAI time validity information of an S-NSSAI indicates that the S-NSSAI is not available, then: message with the S-NSSAI identifying the network slice, the AMF shall: 1) a configured NSSAI including the S-NSSAI together with the S-NSSAI time validity information in the Registration Accept message if the S-NSSAI will become available again; or 2) a configured NSSAI not including the S-NSSAI in the Registration Accept message if the S-NSSAI will not become available again; or validity information, reject the S-NSSAI for the current PLMN or SNPN. If the registration request is accepted, the AMF shall include a configured NSSAI not including the S-NSSAI; b) if the AMF detects that the S-NSSAI is included in the allowed NSSAI i) indicated that it supports S-NSSAI time validity information, the AMF shall locally remove the S-NSSAI from the allowed NSSAI (if any) and the partially allowed NSSAI (if any); or ii) not indicated that it supports S-NSSAI time validity information, the AMF shall remove the S-NSSAI from the stored configured NSSAI (if any), allowed NSSAI (if any), and partially allowed NSSAI (if any) by sending the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message. When the S-NSSAI time validity information of an S-NSSAI indicates that the S-NSSAI becomes available again, the AMF shall update the configured supports S-NSSAI time validity information by sending CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message if the UE is subscribed to the S-NSSAI. The S-NSSAI time validity information is applicable for the current PLMN or SNPN regardless of the access type. Mobility management based network slice usage control If the UE and the network support network slice usage control, the AMF inactivity timer per S-NSSAI and access type.
The AMF may also provide on-demand NSSAI to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
The on-demand NSSAI consists of one or more on-demand S-NSSAIs and, optionally, the slice deregistration inactivity timer per on-demand S-NSSAI. The slice deregistration inactivity timer is: a) started when there is no established PDU session, including any MA PDU session, associated with the S-NSSAI over the corresponding access session, associated with the S-NSSAI is successfully established over the corresponding access type(s) or the S-NSSAI is removed from the If the slice deregistration inactivity timer value is updated, the AMF updates the stored timer value and may provide the updated timer value to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE When the UE receives an updated slice deregistration inactivity timer value in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message from the AMF, the UE updates the stored timer value. Upon expiry of the slice deregistration inactivity timer, the AMF locally removes the S-NSSAI from the allowed NSSAI over the access type. In addition, the AMF may send the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the UEs with the new allowed NSSAI. The UE includes the on-demand S-NSSAI which the UE requests in the requested NSSAI during the registration procedure.
Upon expiry of the slice deregistration inactivity timer, the UE locally removes the S-NSSAI from the allowed NSSAI over the access type. If the UE supports network slice usage control, the AMF provides on-demand NSSAI in the Configured NSSAI to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or in the UE Configuration Update Command message.
The on-demand NSSAI consists of one or more configured S-NSSAIs. The on-demand S-NSSAI(s) is deleted by the UE from the stored on-demand NSSAI, when the associated configured S-NSSAI(s) is deleted by the UE from the stored configured NSSAI. NOTE: The network slice usage control feature is not supported in 0 Mobility management aspects of handling network slices with NS-AoS not matching deployed tracking areas An operator can choose to let the NS-AoS of an S-NSSAI not match the existing tracking area boundaries (see subclause8 of 3GPPTS201).
In order to support this deployment option, the operator has to ensure that an AMF covering the NS-AoS operates as The support for S-NSSAI location validity information by the UE and the validity information, the UE indicates that it supports S-NSSAI location validity information during the registration procedure (see supports S-NSSAI location validity information with S-NSSAI location validity information (see subclauses and\).
The S-NSSAI location validity information consists of, for each of the applicable S-NSSAI(s) in the configured NSSAI: a) an S-NSSAI; and b) a list of cell identities of TA(s) belonging to the registration area where the related S-NSSAI(s) is available in some cells but not all cells of one or more TAs, which represents the NS-AoS of the S-NSSAI. The UE shall consider itself to be inside the NS-AoS if the cell identity of the current serving cell matches any of the identities in the S-NSSAI location validity information.
Otherwise, the UE shall consider itself to be outside the NS-AoS. NOTE1: The cell identity of the current serving cell is received from For an S-NSSAI in the S-NSSAI location validity information, even if the set to "S-NSSAI not available in the current registration area" or is included in the partially rejected NSSAI, the UE is allowed to request the S-NSSAI if the UE determines that it is inside the NS-AoS of the For an S-NSSAI limited by NS-AoS, if the UE in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode does not support S-NSSAI location validity information and the AMF determines a) the UE is not in the NS-AoS, then the AMF may: NOTE2: If excluding the S-NSSAI limited by NS-AoS results in an empty allowed NSSAI or partially allowed NSSAI, the AMF includes one or more default S-NSSAIs in the provided allowed NSSAI or partially allowed 2) indicate to the SMF to release all PDU sessions associated with the b) the UE is in the NS-AoS, then the AMF may update the configured NSSAI to include the S-NSSAI in the configured NSSAI. If the UE that does not support S-NSSAI location validity information and the AMF determines that the UE is not in the NS-AoS, the AMF may perform S-NSSAI based congestion control for the S-NSSAI as specified in The S-NSSAI location validity information is only applicable to 3GPP 1 Mobility management for partial network slice A serving PLMN or SNPN can indicate the S-NSSAI(s) is allowed or rejected in some TA(s) but not all TAs of the registration area to the UE during the registration procedure as specified in subclause and the generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in If the UE supports the partial network slice and includes the S-NSSAI(s) in the requested NSSAI and: a) if the S-NSSAI(s) is allowed in the current TA but not all TAs of the 1) if the S-NSSAI(s) is subject to NSAC for the maximum number of UEs, the AMF should include the S-NSSAI(s) in the allowed NSSAI to the UE and limit the registration area so that the S-NSSAI(s) is allowed in all the TAs of the registration area; 2) if the S-NSSAI(s) is subject to NSSAA, the AMF shall include the i) the pending NSSAI to the UE when the AMF is going to perform the network slice-specific authentication and authorization for the ii) the partially allowed NSSAI to the UE after the network slice-specific authentication and authorization for the S-NSSAI(s) has been successfully performed; and 3) otherwise, the AMF shall include the S-NSSAI(s) in the partially allowed NSSAI to the UE; or b) if the S-NSSAI(s) is rejected in the current TA but not all TAs of the registration area; and 1) if the S-NSSAI is subject to NSAC for the maximum number of UEs, the AMF should include the S-NSSAI(s) in the partially rejected NSSAI to the 2) if the S-NSSAI(s) is subject to NSSAA, the AMF shall include the i) the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE when the AMF determines not to perform the network slice-specific authentication and authorization for ii) the pending NSSAI to the UE when the AMF is going to perform the network slice-specific authentication and authorization for the iii) either the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE after the network slice-specific authentication and authorization for the S-NSSAI(s) has been successfully performed; NOTE1: The AMF determines whether to perform the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure for the partial network slice based on its own local policy. inactivity timer on the AMF side as specified in subclause, the AMF shall include the S-NSSAI(s) in the partially rejected NSSAI to the 4) otherwise, the AMF shall include the S-NSSAI(s) in either the partially allowed NSSAI or the partially rejected NSSAI to the UE; or c) if the partially allowed NSSAI, the partially rejected NSSAI, or both are changed, the AMF shall provide the new partially allowed NSSAI, the new partially rejected NSSAI, or both to the UE. Upon receiving the partially allowed NSSAI, the UE shall regard the S-NSSAI(s) included in partially allowed NSSAI as the allowed S-NSSAI(s) for the current registration area and store the received partially allowed NSSAI as specified in subclause Upon receiving the partially rejected NSSAI, the UE shall store the received partially rejected NSSAI as specified in subclause The UE shall not attempt to include the S-NSSAI in the requested NSSAI if the current TAI is in the list of TAs for which S-NSSAI is rejected.

(DNN) if there is no established PDU session adequate for the PDU transmission.
The S-NSSAI included is part of allowed NSSAI of the serving PLMN or SNPN, which is an S-NSSAI value valid in the serving PLMN or SNPN, and in roaming scenarios the mapped S-NSSAI is also included for the PDU session if available.
See subclause for session or use one of the established PDU session(s) based on the URSP rules which include S-NSSAIs, if any (see subclause), or based on UE local configuration, as described in subclause of Session management based network slice admission control A serving PLMN or the HPLMN, or SNPN can perform network slice admission control for the S-NSSAI(s) subject to NSAC to monitor and control the total number of established PDU sessions per network slice.
The SMF performs network slice admission control on the S-NSSAI during the PDU session establishment procedure.
If the maximum number of PDU sessions the SMF rejects the PDU session establishment request using S-NSSAI based congestion control as specifed in subclause and The SMF performs network slice admission control on the S-NSSAI for a PDU session that is associated with the non-3GPP access, when the UE access with the Allowed PDU session status IE as described in slice associated with an S-NSSAI has been already reached, the SMF rejects the request to establish the user-plane resources (see Based on operator policy, the session management based network slice admission control is not applicable for the PDU session for emergency services, or the session management based network slice admission control result is ignored for the PDU session for emergency services. Based on operator policy, the session management based network slice admission control is not applicable for the PDU session for priority services, or the session management based network slice admission control result is ignored for the PDU session for priority services.

NOTE2: For the MA PDU session during the PDU session establishment procedure, the SMF performs network slice admission control only when it is newly established over the associated access type. slice admission control for each PDU session independently. Support of network slice admission control and interworking with EPC network slice admission control for the S-NSSAI(s) subject to NSAC to monitor and control the number of UEs per network slice and number of PDU sessions per network slice during the PDN connection establishment associated with an S-NSSAI have already been reached, the network rejects the PDN connectivity request using ESM cause #26 "insufficient resources" as specifed in 3GPPTS201. NOTE: If there are more than one S-NSSAI associated with the APN used in the PDN connectivity request and some of but not all associated S-NSSAIs are not available due to either maximum number of UEs reached or maximum number of PDU sessions reached, the network can use the associated S-NSSAI for which maximum number of UEs and maximum number of PDU sessions have not reached to avoid PDN connectivity request rejection. Session management based network slice data rate limitation control A serving PLMN or the HPLMN can perform network slice data rate limitation control for the S-NSSAI(s) subject to network slice data rate limitation control to monitor and control the total data rate of established PDU sessions per network slice as specified in 3GPPTS203.
If the maximum data rate of PDU sessions on a network slice associated with an S-NSSAI has been exceeded during the PDU session establishment procedure, the SMF may reject the PDU session establishment request using S-NSSAI based congestion control as specified in subclause and A serving PLMN or the HPLMN can perform management of Slice-Maximum Bit Rate per UE (UE-Slice-MBR) as specified in 3GPPTS203.
When the UE-Slice-MBR for the UE and S-NSSAI to which the PDU session is allocated is exceeded during the PDU session establishment procedure, the SMF may reject the PDU session establishment request using S-NSSAI based congestion control as specified in subclause and NOTE1: Based on operator policy, the network slice data rate limitation control can be not applicable for the S-NSSAI(s) used for emergency services or priority services. NOTE2: The network slice data rate limitation control and UE-Slice-MBR management are performed by the PCF. Session management based network slice replacement.
a) the UE and network support network slice replacement; b) the UE is provided with the mapping information between the S-NSSAI to be replaced and the alternative S-NSSAI; and the UE provides both the S-NSSAI to be replaced and the alternative S-NSSAI during PDU session establishment procedure.
If the timer T3584 or timer T3585 is running for the S-NSSAI to be replaced, the UE should not stop the timer during PDU session establishment procedure.
If the SMF receives both the S-NSSAI to be replaced and the alternative S-NSSAI during PDU session establishment procedure, the SMF proceeds with the PDU session establishment procedure with the alternative S-NSSAI.
If the PDU session establishment request is accepted, the SMF includes the alternative S-NSSAI in the PDU session establishment accept message. alternative S-NSSAI, the UE provides both the VPLMN alternative S-NSSAI and the VPLMN S-NSSAI in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message. Alternative S-NSSAI, the UE provides both the HPLMN alternative S-NSSAI and the HPLMN S-NSSAI in the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message. The AMF sends both HPLMN alternative S-NSSAI and HPLMN S-NSSAI to the If the SMF receives from the AMF an alternative S-NSSAI for existing PDU a) if the SMF decides to retain the existing PDU session (i.
the SMF can serve both the alternative S-NSSAI and the S-NSSAI to be replaced with), the SMF sends the alternative S-NSSAI to the UE during network-requested PDU session modification procedure; or b) if the SMF decides to re-activate the existing PDU session and: 1) if the SSC mode of the PDU session is SSC mode 3, the SMF initiates PDU session modification procedure to trigger PDU session reactivation by the UE; or 2) if the SSC mode of the PDU session is SSC mode 1 or SSC mode 2, the SMF initiates PDU session release procedure to trigger PDU session reactivation by the UE. If the timer T3584 or timer T3585 is running for the S-NSSAI that was replaced and the S-NSSAI that was replaced in alternative NSSAI is available and the AMF provides the updated allowed NSSAI and configured NSSAI to the UE, the UE should stop the timer. Session management for optimized handling of temporarily available network slices A network slice can be available temporarily.
Subclause addresses how the allowed NSSAI and partially allowed NSSAI are managed based on the S-NSSAI time validity information. If the S-NSSAI time validity information indicates that the S-NSSAI is If the S-NSSAI time validity information indicates that the S-NSSAI is not available, then the UE shall: a) initiate UE-requested PDU session release procedure to release any PDU session associated with the S-NSSAI, if the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode or in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication; or b) locally release any PDU session associated with the S-NSSAI, if the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode. When the S-NSSAI time validity information in the AMF indicates that the S-NSSAI is not available, independent of whether the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication or in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the AMF shall request the SMF to release any PDU session associated with the S-NSSAI. Session management for partial network slice If the S-NSSAI is included in the partially allowed NSSAI and: a) if the current TAI is in the list of TAs for which the S-NSSAI is allowed, the UE can initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure for the S-NSSAI; or b) if the current TAI is not in the list of TAs for which the S-NSSAI is allowed, the UE shall not initiate the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure for the S-NSSAI. If an existing PDU session is established for the S-NSSAI included in the partially allowed NSSAI and: a) if the current TAI is changed and the current TAI is in the list of TAs for which the S-NSSAI is allowed, the UE can initiate the service request procedure to re-establish the user plane resources for the established PDU session or the UE can initiate UL NAS TRANSPORT messages carrying control plane user data or the SMF can send control plane user data to the UE; or b) if the current TAI is changed and the current TAI is not in the list of TAs for which the S-NSSAI is allowed, the SMF and the UE shall maintain the 5GSM contexts for the established PDU session.
The UE shall not initiate UL NAS TRANSPORT messages carrying control plane user data and the SMF shall not send control plane user data to the UE. The session management for partial network slice is not applicable to the PDU session established for onboarding services in SNPN. Session management aspect of handling network slices with NS-AoS not matching deployed tracking areas the UE shall not: a) attempt to request the establishment of user plane resources of any PDU session associated with the S-NSSAI; and b) initiate UL NAS TRANSPORT messages carrying control plane user data. the SMF shall not: a) attempt to establish user plane resources of any PDU session associated with the S-NSSAI; and b) send control plane user data to the UE. NOTE: A PDU session associated with an S-NSSAI is not released solely NAS over non-3GPP access.
From the UE's NAS perspective, in general the procedures and messages defined for 5GMM and 5GSM are used over non-3GPP access as over 3GPP 5GS mobility management aspects.
The mobility management procedures defined over 3GPP access are re-used over non-3GPP access with the following exceptions: a) the registration status, and the 5GMM parameters of the UE's 3GPP access and non-3GPP access 5GMM state machine instances are independent in each of these accesses and can be different; b) single-registration mode and dual-registration mode do not apply for 5GMM over non-3GPP access; c) the RPLMN over non-3GPP access can be different from the RPLMN over 3GPP access.
The MCC of the RPLMN over 3GPP access and the MCC of the RPLMN over the non-3GPP access can also be different; d) the registration for 3GPP access and for non-3GPP access are performed separately.
Like for 3GPP access, an access stratum connection exists before the UE can perform the registration procedure for non-3GPP access.
As at registration over non-3GPP access the UE is allocated a management of registration areas is not required, and registration updating due to registration area change with the registered PLMN is not performed.
Furthermore, the periodic registration update procedure is also not performed.
New registration at change of PLMN is required; e) the 5GMM over non-3GPP access in the UE considers that the N1 NAS signalling connection is established when the lower layers indicate that the access stratum connection is established succcessfully; f) the UE-initiated service request procedure via non-3GPP access is supported.
Upon indication from the lower layers of non-3GPP access, that the access stratum connection is established between the UE and the network, the UE in 5GMM-REGISTERED state and in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access shall initiate the service request procedure via non-3GPP access.
The UE may indicate with the service request message the PDU session(s) associated with non-3GPP access to re-establish user-plane resources for which the UE has pending user data to be sent; g) paging procedure is not performed via non-3GPP access; h) service area restrictions do not apply for non-3GPP access other than i) the establishment cause for non-3GPP access is determined according j) eCall inactivity procedure is not performed via non-3GPP access; k) local area data network (LADN) does not apply for non-3GPP access; l) the Allowed PDU session IE shall not be included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message or the SERVICE REQUEST message sent over non-3GPP m) DRX parameters do not apply for non-3GPP access; n) Mobile initiated connection only mode (MICO) does not apply for o) CIoT 5GS optimizations do not apply for non-3GPP access; p) unified access control does not apply for non-3GPP access; q) UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS) does not apply for r) Closed access group (CAG) does not apply for non-3GPP access; s) the N1 NAS signalling connection release, the paging indication for voice services and reject the paging request do not apply for non-3GPP access.
The Paging restriction IE shall not be included in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the SERVICE REQUEST message or the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message sent over non-3GPP access.
The AMF shall not delete any stored paging restriction preferences for the UE and shall not stop restricting paging when receiving REGISTRATION REQUEST message, SERVICE REQUEST message or CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message over non-3GPP access; t) the partially allowed NSSAI and the partially rejected NSSAI do not apply for non-3GPP access; and u) support for unavailability period (see subclause6) does not apply for non-3GPP access. Establishment cause for non-3GPP access When establishment of an N1 NAS signalling connection over non-3GPP access is initiated, the UE shall: a) determine one or more access identities to be associated with the establishment of the N1 NAS signalling connection as specified in b) select the establishment cause for non-3GPP access from the determined one or more access identities and the event which triggered initiation of the N1 NAS signalling connection over non-3GPP access by checking the rules specified in table; and c) provide the selected establishment cause for non-3GPP access to the While an MMTEL voice call is ongoing: 1) service request procedure; or initiated in 5GMM-IDLE mode is mapped to "MO MMTel voice call" type While an MMTEL video call is ongoing and no MMTEL voice call is ongoing: 1) service request procedure; or initiated in 5GMM-IDLE mode is mapped to "MO MMTel video call" type While an SMSoIP is ongoing, no MMTEL video call is ongoing and no MMTEL voice call is ongoing: 1) service request procedure; or initiated in 5GMM-IDLE mode is mapped to "MO SMS over IP" type access If the access attempt matches more than one rule, the establishment cause for non-3GPP access of the lowest rule number shall be used.

5GS session management aspects The session management procedures defined over 3GPP access are re-used over non-3GPP access with the following exceptions: a) Serving PLMN rate control does not apply for non-3GPP access; b) Small data rate control does not apply for non-3GPP access; c) Handling of 5GSM cause value #82 "maximum data rate per UE for user-plane integrity protection is too low" does not apply for non-3GPP d) MBS does not apply for non-3GPP access; and e) Support of redundant PDU sessions does not apply for non-3GPP access. Limited service state over non-3GPP access limited service state over non-3GPP access.
These include: a) no USIM in the ME; b) an "illegal UE" or "illegal ME" is received when registration, network-initiated de-registration or service request is performed (any USIM in the ME is then considered "invalid"); network-initiated de-registration or service request is performed; d) a "PLMN not allowed" is received when registration, network-initiated de-registration or service request is performed; network-initiated de-registration or service request is performed; f) a "Roaming not allowed in this tracking area" is received when a registration, network-initiated de-registration or service request is service request is performed. selection is performed as defined in 3GPPTS202. With the exception of performing initial registration for emergency present.
For registration for emergency services, the PLMN of the current N3IWF or TNGF is considered as the selected PLMN for the duration the UE is registered for emergency services. NAS signalling using trusted WLAN access network A trusted WLAN interworking function (TWIF) provides functionalities for a non-5G capable over WLAN (N5CW) device to access 5GCN, including: a) NAS signalling over N1 NAS signalling connection with AMF; and b) PDU session establishment, modification and release on behalf of the N5CW device, over N2 connection with the AMF. The TWIF registers on behalf of the N5CW device to an AMF according to subclause by populating the parameters for the registration by using implementation specific default values which are the same for N5CW subclause on behalf of the N5CW device upon receipt of an IP configuration request from the N5CW device by populating either all the required parameters or part of the required parameters for the PDU session establishment by using implementation specific default values from the TWIF's configuration.
Only one PDU session is supported when N5CW device accessing 5GC via the TWIF. NOTE1: If part of the required parameters for the PDU session establishment is provided by the TWIF, the remaining of the required parameters are determined by the AMF or the SMF based on the N5CW Upon loss of the IP address of the N5CW device, the TWIF acting on behalf of the N5CW device shall initiate the UE-requested PDU session release procedure as defined in subclause NOTE2: The established PDU session on behalf of the N5CW device can be modified by the TWIF or the network. Interworking with E-UTRAN connected to EPC.
In order to interwork with E-UTRAN connected to EPC, the UE supporting both S1 mode and N1 mode can operate in single-registration mode or dual-registration mode (see 3GPPTS201).
Support of single-registration mode is mandatory for UEs supporting both S1 mode During the EPS attach procedure (see 3GPPTS201) or initial registration procedure (see subclause), the mode for interworking is selected if the UE supports both S1 mode and N1 mode, and the network supports interworking.
The mode for interworking may also be selected during the EPS tracking area updating procedure (see 3GPPTS201) or registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see subclause). For interworking between E-UTRAN connected to EPC and TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN, the UE shall operate as specified in either subclause or subclause Which subclause the UE follows is chosen by the UE irrespective of the interworking without N26 interface.

NOTE2: The order of PDU sessions to be tranferred to EPS is up to UE After successful completion of the EPS attach procedure where the activated default EPS bearer context is not for emergency service, the type set to "handover" for non-emergency PDU session or "handover of emergency bearer services" for emergency PDU session in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message to transfer each of the other PDU sessions which the UE intends to transfer to EPS, if any..
a) the UE has not registered in N1 mode over non-3GPP access yet; and b) the UE has at least one active PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer to TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN, the UE shall initiate an initial registration procedure over non-3GPP After successful completion of the 5GS initial registration in N1 mode connections which the UE intends to transfer to TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN, if any.
The request type is set as follows: connection for emergency bearer services, the request type is set to "existing emergency PDU session" to transfer the PDN connection for emergency bearer services; and if the PDN connection which the UE intends to transfer is a non-emergency PDN connection, the request type is set to "existing PDU session" to transfer the non-emergency PDN connection. NOTE3: If the UE has no active PDU session associated with non-3GPP access which the UE in N1 mode intends to transfer to EPS or no active PDN connection associated with 3GPP access which the UE in S1 mode intends to transfer to TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN, the interworking between TNGF or N3IWF connected to 5GCN and E-UTRAN is not supported. See subclause for coordination between 5GSM and ESM. dual-registration mode shall maintain independent contexts for 5GMM and EMM and this includes independent lists of equivalent PLMNs. Coordination between 5GMM and EMM is not needed, except as specified in the present subclause, subclause and 3A. For dual-registration mode the following applies: a) a UE operating in the dual-registration mode may register to N1 mode only, S1 mode only, or to both N1 mode and S1 mode; b) when the UE decides to operate in dual-registration mode (see subclause), NAS informs the lower layers about this; mode the UE shall use: 1) the same PLMN to which it is registered in N1 mode; or 2) an equivalent PLMN; and mode the UE shall use: 1) the same PLMN to which it is registered in S1 mode; or 2) an equivalent PLMN.

When no PDU session is active and the UE has not registered to S1 mode yet, the UE may initiate the EPS attach procedure with PDN connection establishment if EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is not supported by the MME.
If EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection is supported by the MME, the UE may initiate either the EPS attach procedure without PDN connection establishment or the attach procedure with PDN connection When at least one PDU session is active and the UE has not registered to S1 mode yet, the UE may initiate the EPS attach procedure.
If necessary, the UE may transfer an active PDU session from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating the EPS attach procedure with request type set to "handover" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST message.
After successfully attached in S1 mode, if necessary, the UE may transfer other active PDU sessions from N1 mode to S1 mode by initiating the PDN connectivity procedure with request type set to "handover" in the PDN CONNECTIVITY REQUEST NOTE2: It is up to UE implementation to determine which active PDU session is transferred from N1 mode to S1 mode. When the UE has not registered to N1 mode, the UE may initiate the initial registration procedure.
After successfully registered in N1 mode, if necessary, the UE may transfer one or more active PDN connections from S1 mode to N1 mode by initiating the PDU session establishment procedure with request type set to "existing PDU session". NOTE3: It is up to UE implementation to determine which active PDN connection is transferred from S1 mode to N1 mode. If the MME supports EMM-REGISTERED without PDN connection, the UE that transferred all PDN connections to the 5GS, may stay in state EMM-REGISTERED.
Otherwise, the UE shall enter state EMM-DEREGISTERED upon transferring all PDN connection to the 5GS. NOTE4: When the UE has registered in both N1 mode and S1 mode, it is up to UE implementation to maintain the registration update to date in both N1 mode and S1 mode.

A CAG can be optionally used in order to The key enablers for the CAG in the NAS layer are as follows: a) CAG selection (see 3GPPTS222); and b) provisioning of a "CAG information list" as specified in 3GPPTS222, from network to UE via the generic UE configuration update procedure, the registration procedure, the service request procedure, and the network-initiated de-registration procedure. The "CAG information list" provisioned by the network, if available, is stored in the non-volatile memory in the ME as specified in annexC.
The "CAG information list" stored in the ME is kept when the UE enters 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state.
AnnexC specifies condition under which the "CAG information list" stored in the ME is deleted.
Additionally, when a USIM is inserted, if: no "CAG information list" is stored in the non-volatile memory of the the SUPI from the USIM does not match the SUPI stored together with the "CAG information list" in the non-volatile memory of the ME; and the UE has a "CAG information list" stored in the USIM (see 3GPPTS302), the UE shall store the "CAG information list" from the USIM into the ME, as specified in annexC.

A 5GS can support time synchronization and TSC (see 3GPPTS201, 3GPPTS202, and 3GPPTS203).
This subclause describes NAS-specific aspects of the 5GS features to support time synchronization time synchronization or TSC..
Two types of synchronization processes are supported by the 5GS: 5GS synchronization and (g)PTP domain synchronization (see For 5GS synchronization, the lower layers provide the 5G internal system clock signalled via the NG-RAN (see 3GPPTS331) and the UE forwards the 5G internal system clock to the DS-TT(s). For (g)PTP domain synchronization, the UE supports forwarding (g)PTP a) if the UE receives (g)PTP message via the PDU session, the UE forwards the (g)PTP messages to the DS-TT associated with the PDU b) if the UE receives (g)PTP messages from the DS-TT associated with the PDU session, the UE forwards the (g)PTP messages via the PDU session. Depending on the 5G access stratum-based time distribution or (g)PTP-based time distribution, the network timing synchronization status of the nodes involved in the operation (e.
, NG-RAN nodes, NW-TTs) may change.
Using the 5GMM protocol, the network can request a supporting UE to reconnect to the network upon receiving an indication User plane node management (e.
IEEE TSN bridge) or a 5GS can be independently used to enable TSC. network and port management information containers are exchanged between supports transfer of port management information containers, then the UE indicates that transfer of port management information container is PDU session type is Ethernet), port management information container, indicated that transfer of port management information container is supported during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure (see subclause), then port management information containers are network-requested PDU session modification procedure (see information container from the network shall forward the port management information container from the UE shall operate as described in 6 UE radio capability signalling optimisation optional at both the UE and the network and which aims to optimise the transmission of UE radio capability over the radio interface (see 3GPPTS201).
RACS works by assigning an identifier to represent a set of UE radio capabilities.
This identifier is called the UE radio capability ID.
A UE radio capability ID can be either manufacturer-assigned or network-assigned.

A 5GS can support UAV identification, authentication, and authorization (see 3GPPTS256[6AB]).
This subclause describes NAS-specific aspects of the 5GS features to support UAV identification, authentication, authorization and C2 communication authorization. Before accessing 5GS for UAS services, the UE supporting UAS services must have an assigned CAA-levelUAVID.
The UE can be registered to 5GS Authentication and authorization of UAV The 5GS supports the USS UAV Authorization and Authentication (UUAA) or regulatory requirements, the UUAA-MM procedure can be performed by subclause or the UUAA-SM procedure can be performed by the UE subclause The UE shall support UUAA-MM and UUAA-SM, and the network shall support UUAA-SM and may optionally support UUAA-MM.
The UUAA procedure needs to be performed by 5GS with USS successfully before the connectivity for UAS services is established. During the registration procedure as described in subclause, the UE supporting UAS services provides CAA-levelUAVID to the AMF, and the AMF may trigger the UUAA-MM procedure.
If the UE supporting UAS services does not provide CAA-level UAV ID to the AMF and the network is configured to perform UUAA-MM at registration procedure, the AMF may accept the registration request and shall mark in the UE's 5GMM context that the UE is not allowed to request UAS services.

If the UE does not provide CAA-level UAV ID and the user’s subscription data for the UE requires the UUAA-SM, the network rejects the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure for the UAS services. The UE supporting UAS services shall not provide CAA-level UAV ID to the network over non-3GPP access, and the network shall not perform UUAA procedure for non-3GPP access and shall ensure that the UE is not allowed to access any aerial services in non-3GPP access. If provided by the upper layers, the UE supporting UAS services provides to the network the USS address during the registration procedure or PDU session establishment procedure so that the network uses the information to discover the USS. NOTE: The parameters (e.
, CAA-level UAV ID or USS address) sent by a UE supporting UAS services to the network for UAS services are included After successful UUAA procedure, either the AMF or the SMF may initiate re-authentication of the UAV when required by the USS.
If UUAA-MM fails UAS services, the AMF shall request the SMF to perform the release of procedure based on operator policy.
If UUAA-SM fails during a re-authentication, the SMF shall release the PDU session related to If the UUAA is revoked, the PDU session related to the UAS services shall be released by the SMF.
Based on operator policy, the AMF may Authorization of C2 communication The 5GS supports USS authorization of C2 communication for pairing of UAV and UAV-C.
The pairing of UAV and UAV-C needs to be authorized by USS successfully before the user plane connectivity for C2 communication (over Uu or over NR-PC5) is enabled.
For C2 authorization procedure, the UE supporting UAS services provides to the network with CAA-level UAV The USS authorization of UAV flight can also be performed during the C2 authorization procedure.
The UE supporting UAS services provides the UAV flight authorization information to the network if provided by upper NOTE1: The C2 authorization payload in the service-level-AA payload can include one, some or all of the pairing information for C2 communication, an indication of the request for direct C2 communication, pairing information for direct C2 communication, and the UAV flight authorization information (see subclauses and\). communication by providing the CAA-levelUAVID and the C2 authorization payload.

If the pairing of UAV and UAV-C is revoked, the network shall disable C2 communication for the PDU session.
The SMF upon reception of the UE's request for the PDU session establishment, determines that authorization is required based on the DNN and S-NSSAI combination of the PDU session is for aerial services according to user's subscription data and the CAA-levelUAVID included in the request. NOTE2: The network can disable C2 communication for the PDU session e.
, by removing the QoS flow for C2 communication during PDU session modification procedure as decribed in subclauses respectively, USS communication and C2 communication, the C2 communication is authorized using UUAA-SM during the PDU session establishment procedure.
If the pairing of UAV and UAV-C is revoked, the PDU session for C2 communication shall be released by the SMF. During the registration procedure for UAS services, direct C2 supporting A2X over NR-PC5 can perform registration procedure for UAS communication by providing CAA-levelUAVID and C2 authorization.

AnnexC specifies condition under which the indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE, the indication of 'applicability of "lists of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition" provided by a VPLMN', the one or more "lists of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition", disaster roaming wait range and disaster return wait range stored in the ME are deleted. the selected PLMN as described in subclause; and running, the UE shall not initiate registration on the selected PLMN except if the UE needs to request an emergency PDU session, in which case the UE shall initiate the registration procedure, set the 5GS registration type IE to "emergency registration" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and keep the timer running.
Upon expiration of the timer, if the UE does not have an emergency PDU session, the UE shall described in subclause if still camped on the selected PLMN.
If the UE has an emergency PDU session when the timer expires, the registration procedure for disaster roaming services as described in subclause shall be performed after the release of the emergency PDU session, if the UE is still camped on the selected PLMN. as described in 3GPPTS222, if: a) the UE has successfully registered over non-3GPP access on another b) the UE has successfully registered with an allowable PLMN; or c) an NG-RAN cell selected for camping of the selected PLMN broadcasts neither the disaster related indication nor a "list of one or more PLMN(s) with disaster condition for which disaster roaming services is offered by the available PLMN" including the determined PLMN with Disaster Condition (see 3GPPTS222). shall perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPPTS222: a timer with the generated random number value.
While the timer is running, the UE shall not initiate registration on the selected PLMN except if the UE needs to request an emergency PDU session, in which case the UE shall initiate the registration procedure, set the 5GS registration type IE to "emergency registration" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message and keep the timer running.
Upon expiration of the timer, if the UE does not have an emergency PDU session, the UE shall If the UE has an emergency PDU session when the timer expires, the registration procedure as described in subclause shall be performed after the release of the emergency PDU session, if the UE is still camped on the selected PLMN. disaster roaming services, the AMF shall only include TAIs covering the area with the disaster condition. When the AMF determines that the disaster condition has ended and the UE which is registered for disaster roaming services has an emergency PDU session, the AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure to indicate that the UE is registered for emergency services as described in subclause Interworking with EPS is not supported for UEs that are registered for disaster roaming services.
When registering for disaster roaming services, the UE indicates to the network that S1 mode is not supported as described in subclause While registered for disaster or perform emergency services fallback, the UE initiates the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update and indicates that S1 mode is supported as described in subclause If the UE is registered for disaster roaming services and the registered PLMN is removed from forbidden PLMN lists due to reasons specified in 3GPPTS222 subclause or in 3GPPTS222 AnnexC, then UE shall initiate the de-registration procedure and perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPPTS222. 5 Support of MUSIM features (i.
the N1 NAS signalling connection release, the paging indication for voice services, the reject paging request, the paging restriction and the paging timing collision control). If MUSIM UE supports one or more MUSIM features, the UE indicates support of one or more MUSIM features (except for the paging timing collision control) during the registration procedure.
If the UE has indicated support of the N1 NAS signalling connection release or the reject paging request or both and the UE supports the paging restriction, the UE indicates support of the paging restriction. If the UE indicates support of one or more MUSIM features and the network decides to accept one or more MUSIM features, the network indicates the support of one or more MUSIM features during the registration procedure.
The network only indicates the support of the paging restriction together with the support of either N1 NAS signalling connection release or the reject paging request. The network does not indicate support for any MUSIM feature to the UE during the registration for emergency services. If the UE is not currently registered for emergency service and the UE receives the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with the 5GS registration result IE value set to "Registered for emergency services", then UE shall behave as if the network did not indicate support for any MUSIM feature in the last registration procedure.
If the network has sent CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with the 5GS registration result IE value set to "Registered for emergency services", then network shall behave as if it did not indicate support for any MUSIM feature in the last registration procedure. defined in subclause, and the UE has negotiated support of one or for mobility and periodic registration update to indicate that all the MUSIM features are not supported (except for the paging timing collision control) as specified in subclause indicate the support for paging indication for voice services during the registration procedure towards the network. 6 Support for Personal IoT Network service The 5GS can support the Personal IoT Network (PIN) service (see The PIN enables the Personal IoT Network Elements (PINEs) to communicate with each other via PIN direct communication, PIN indirect communication or PIN-DN communication.
For the PIN indirect communication and PIN-DN (PEGC) enables the PINEs behind the PEGC to connect to the network and to communicate with other PINEs within the PIN or with the DN via the PDU session established for PIN.
A PEGC may serve one or more PINs.
The PEGC establishes only one PDU session for each PIN.
The PEGC establishes different PDU sessions for different PINs based on different DNNs and S-NSSAIs.
The PEGC may establish only one PDU session for multiple PINs if traffic differentiation for multiple PINs is not required in 5GS. NOTE1: The PIN direct communication is out of the scope of 3GPP. The PIN, PEGC, and PINEs are managed by PIN Element with Management Capability (PEMC) and optionally the corresponding application function. Each PIN contains at least one PEGC and at least one PEMC.
The PIN architecture is captured in 3GPPTS201. The 5GS supports the delivery of URSP rules which include the PIN ID to a PEGC registered to 5GS (see 3GPPTS201 and 3GPPTS203).
The 5GS is enhanced to support the PDU session management for PIN to ensure the end-to-end QoS requirement. The end-to-end QoS requirement for each PINE over PIN indirect communication and over PIN-DN communication includes: a) the QoS requirement in the 3GPP access network; and b) the QoS requirement in the non-3GPP access network. differentiation for the PINEs in the non-3GPP access network.
If the UE supports receiving the N3QAI, the network may provide the N3QAI associated with the QoS flow during the PDU session establishment procedure as defined in subclause or during the PDU session modification procedure as defined in subclause NOTE2: How the PEGC applies N3QAI is outside the scope of the present The non-3GPP delay budget refers to the delay budget between the PEGC and the PINE in the non-3GPP access network.
If the UE supports providing the non-3GPP delay budget, the UE may provide the network with the non-3GPP delay budget for the one or more QoS flows associated with as defined in subclause The network takes into account the received non-3GPP delay budget to ensure the end-to-end QoS requirement specified in this release of specification. NOTE4: The support of redundant PDU sessions does not apply for PIN. 7 Mobile base station relay support subclause5A of 3GPPspecification document).
This subclause describes NAS-specific aspects of the 5GS features to support the authorization of the MBSR-UE, and the control of the UE access via MBSR. subscription information.
The AMF can indicate to the MBSR-UE that it is not allowed to operate as MBSR during registration procedure as Enhanced CAG information can be used for the control of UE's access via MBSR.
CAG identifier is used to control the access of UE via MBSR.
5GC supports the UE access control based on the PLMND ID and CAG identifier broadcast by the MBSR and the CAG-ID authorized based on "Allowed CAG list" in the PLMN's entry of "CAG information list" stored in the UE. Time validity information can be provided to the UE together with the CAG identifier for accessing to MBSR in order to control that UE not accessing the MBSR cell outside of the time validity information.
For the UE not supporting CAG functionality, 5GC can control the access of the UE with managing the forbidden tracking area. 5 Elementary procedures for 5GS mobility management.
The main function of the 5GS mobility management (5GMM) sublayer is to A further function of the 5GMM sublayer is to provide connection management services to the other sublayer(s). delay transmission of an initial UL NAS message by up to 100 seconds Types of 5GMM procedures Depending on how they can be initiated, three types of 5GMM procedures a) 5GMM common procedures: 5GMM common procedure can always be initiated when the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.
The procedures belonging to this type are: 1) Initiated by the network: i) network-initiated NAS transport; ii) primary authentication and key agreement; iii) security mode control; iv) generic UE configuration update; vi) network slice-specific authentication and authorization; 2) Initiated by the UE: 3) Initiated by the UE or the network and used to report certain error conditions detected upon receipt of 5GMM protocol data: b) 5GMM specific procedures: At any time only one UE initiated 5GMM specific procedure can be running for each of the access network(s) that the UE is camping in.
The procedures belonging to this type are: 1) Initiated by the UE and used e.
to register to the network for 5GS services and establish a 5GMM context, to update the location/parameter(s) of the UE: 2) Initiated by the UE or the network and used to deregister from the network for 5GS services and to release a 5GMM context: 3) Initiated by the UE and used to deregister from the network for 5GS services and to release a 5GMM context: c) 5GMM connection management procedures: network or to request the resource reservation for sending data, or The service request procedure can only be initiated if no UE initiated 5GMM specific procedure is ongoing for each of the access network(s) that the UE is camping in. 2) Initiated by the network and used to request the establishment of an N1 NAS signalling connection or to request re-establishment of user-plane resources for the PDU session(s) associated with 3GPP access or to request re-establishment of user-plane resources of the PDU session(s) associated with non-3GPP access over 3GPP access; not applicable for the non-3GPP access network: 3) Initiated by the network and used to request re-establishment of user-plane resources of the PDU session(s) associated with non-3GPP access over 3GPP access or to deliver 5GSM downlink signalling messages associated with non-3GPP access over 3GPP access, when the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access and in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP Initiated by the network and used to request re-establishment of user-plane resources of the PDU session(s) associated with 3GPP access over 3GPP access or to deliver downlink signalling associated with 3GPP access over 3GPP access, when the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access, and when the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access and not in MICO mode: NOTE1: In NB-N1 mode, the UE NAS using 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS optimization can wait for the lower layers to complete the transmission of the previous UL NAS TRANSPORT messages carrying control plane user data before providing subsequent NAS messages.
Other NOTE2: When providing NAS messages to the lower layers for transmission, the UE NAS using 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS optimization can prioritize sending NAS signalling messages over the UL NAS TRANSPORT messages carrying control plane user data.
How the UE performs this prioritization is implementation specific..

In this release of the specification, the IMEI, the IMEISV, the MAC address together with the MAC address usage restriction indication and the EUI-64 are the only PEI formats supported by 5GS.
The structure of the PEI and its formats are specified in 3GPPTS203. Each UE supporting at least one 3GPP access technology (i.
satellite NG-RAN, NG-RAN, satellite E-UTRAN, E-UTRAN, UTRAN or GERAN) contains a PEI in the IMEI format and shall be able to provide an IMEI and an IMEISV upon request from the network.

In case of PLMN the 5G-GUTI is globally unique and in case of SNPN the 5G-GUTI is unique within an SNPN.
When the UE is registered to the same PLMN or SNPN over 3GPP and non-3GPP access, the UE and the AMF maintain one 5G-GUTI that is common to both 3GPP and non-3GPP access.
When the UE is required to delete the 5G-GUTI according registered to the same PLMN or SNPN through other access.
When the UE is registered to different PLMNs or SNPNs over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the UE maintains two 5G-GUTIs, a 5G-GUTI for the registration registration with another PLMN or SNPN over the non-3GPP access.
In the the 5G S-temporary mobile subscriber identity (5G-S-TMSI), is used to enable more efficient radio signalling.
The purpose of the 5G-GUTI and 5G-S-TMSI is to provide identity confidentiality, i.
, to protect a user from being identified and located by an intruder.
The structure of the 5G-GUTI and its derivatives are specified in 3GPPTS203.
The 5G-GUTI has two main components (see 3GPPTS201): a) the GUAMI; and b) the 5G-TMSI that provides an unambiguous identity of the UE within the AMF(s) identified by the GUAMI. The 5G-S-TMSI has three main components: a) the AMF set ID that uniquely identifies the AMF set within the AMF b) the AMF pointer that identifies one or more AMFs within the AMF set; in the REGISTRATION REQUEST and DEREGISTRATION REQUEST messages.

Mobile initiated connection only mode The UE can request the use of mobile initiated connection only (MICO) mode during the registration procedure (see 3GPPTS201 and 3GPPTS202).
The UE shall not request use of MICO mode over non-3GPP access.
Furthermore, the UE in 3GPP access shall not request the use of MICO mode during: a) a registration procedure for initial registration for emergency b) a registration procedure for initial registration for initiating an emergency PDU session (see subclause); c) a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see subclause) for initiating an emergency PDU session if the UE is in the state d) a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see subclause) when the UE has an emergency PDU session If the UE requests the use of MICO mode, the network can accept the use registration procedure.
The UE may use MICO mode only if the network has provided the MICO indication IE during the last registration procedure. The UE may also request an active time value together with the MICO mode indication during the registration procedure.
If the UE requests an active time by including an active time value, the UE may also include If the network accepts the use of MICO mode and does not include an active time value in T3324 IE to the UE, the AMF may include an "all PLMN registration area allocated" indication in the MICO indication IE to the UE.
If the UE indicated the support for strictly periodic registration timer in the MICO indication IE to the network, the network may include a "strictly periodic registration timer supported" indication in the MICO indication IE to the UE. If the UE requested the use of active time by including an active time value and the network accepts the use of MICO mode and the use of active time, the AMF shall include an active time value in the T3324 IE to the UE.
If the AMF indicates active time value to the UE, AMF should not indicate "all PLMN registration area allocated" indication in the MICO indication IE to the UE.
Upon entering 5GMM-IDLE mode, AMF shall start the active timer with the active time value indicated to the UE and shall consider the UE is reachable for paging as long as the timer is running.
If the UE enters 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access when the active timer is running, the AMF shall stop the active timer. NOTE1: The active time value assigned by AMF can be different from the active time value requested by the UE.
AMF assigns the active time value based on several factors, e.
local configuration, expected UE behaviour, UE requested active time value, UE subscription information, network accepts the use of MICO mode, the AMF shall take the UE If the network accepts the use of MICO mode, the UE may deactivate the AS layer and activate MICO mode by entering the state a) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over3GPP access; b) the UE is in the 5GMM-REGISTERED.

If the network accepts the use of MICO mode and indicates an active time start the timer T3324 with the value received from the network after entering 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access.
At the expiry of the timer T3324, the UE may activate MICO mode by entering the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.
NO-CELL-AVAILABLE if the UE is in the (as described in subclause) state for 3GPP access.
If the UE enters 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access when the timer T3324 is running, the UE shall stop the timer T332 When MICO mode is activated, all NAS timers are stopped and associated periodic search for HPLMN or EHPLMN or higher prioritized PLMNs (see NOTE2: When MICO mode is activated and if the UE is also registered with access type indicating 3GPP access over the non-3GPP access for PDU sessions associated with 3GPP access. The UE may deactivate MICO mode and activate the AS layer at any time. Upon deactivating MICO mode, the UE may initiate 5GMM procedures (e.
g. for the transfer of mobile originated signalling or user data). When an emergency PDU session is successfully established after the MICO mode was enabled, the UE and the AMF shall locally disable MICO mode. The UE and the AMF shall not enable MICO mode until the AMF accepts the use of MICO mode in the next registration procedure.
To enable an duration of time before requesting the use of MICO mode after the completion of the emergency services. If the AMF accepts the use of MICO mode and does not indicate "strictly periodic registration timer supported" in the MICO indication IE to the UE, the AMF starts the implicit de-registration timer for 3GPP access when entering 5GMM-IDLE mode for 3GPP access.
If AMF accepts the use of MICO mode and indicates "strictly periodic registration timer supported" in the MICO indication IE to the UE, AMF shall start the strictly periodic monitoring timer with T3512 value indicated in the T3512 value IE after the registration procedure is completed.
The AMF shall neither stop nor reset the strictly periodic monitoring timer when the NAS signalling connection is established or released for the UE.
If the strictly periodic monitoring timer expires when NAS signalling connection is established for the UE, AMF shall restart the strictly periodic monitoring timer with the T3512 value, otherwise AMF shall start the implicit de-registration timer. When an emergency PDU session is successfully established and the MICO mode is disabled, the UE shall stop timer T3512 if running and the AMF shall stop strictly periodic monitoring timer if running.
The UE and the AMF shall behave as if no "strictly periodic registration timer supported" indication was given to the UE in the last registration Upon successful completion of an attach procedure or tracking area updating procedure after inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode (see 3GPPTS201), the UE operating in single-registration mode shall locally disable MICO mode.
After inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE operating in single-registration mode may re-negotiate MICO mode with the network during the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update. multicast MBS sessions, the UE may deactivate MICO mode and activate the AS layer at the MBS start time and at any of the scheduled activation and activate the AS layer at the broadcast start time and at any of the of those times are available as specified in 3GPPTS247. NOTE3: The UE can obtain via the service announcement an MBS start 3GPPTS247, or both, which is out of scope of this specification.
Similarly, the UE can obtain via the service announcement session as described in 3GPPTS247, which is out of scope of NOTE4: Deactivating MICO mode and activating the AS layer at the MBS session which the has UE joined and to respond to it if received.
How long the UE needs to listen to paging is up to UE implementation. Similarly, deactivating MICO mode and activating the AS layer at the broadcast start time and the scheduled broadcast activation times of a broadcast MBS session allows the UE to acquire the traffic of the When MICO mode is activated, the UE is allowed to join one or more multicast MBS sessions.
In that case, the UE can deactivate MICO mode and activate the AS layer at the MBS start time and at any of the times are available as specified in 3GPPTS247, and the UE joins one or more multicast MBS sessions by using the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure or the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure (see subclauses and). NOTE5: It is up to UE implementation whether to leave one or more multicast MBS sessions after each deactivation of each multicast MBS session and to re-join again at the next activation time or to keep a multicast MBS session that the UE has joined for the whole period of the session, as described in 3GPPTS247. Handling of the periodic registration update timer and mobile reachable timer The periodic registration update procedure is used over 3GPP access to periodically notify the availability of the UE to the network.
The procedure is controlled in the UE by the periodic registration update If the UE is registered over the 3GPP access, the AMF maintains an implicit de-registration timer to control when the UE is considered implicitly de-registered over the 3GPP access.
If the UE is registered de-registration timer to control when the UE is considered implicitly de-registered over the non-3GPP access.

The non-3GPP de-registration timer is stopped when the UE enters 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access or the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state over non-3GPP access. The non-3GPP implicit de-registration timer shall be longer than the The value of timer T3512 is sent by the network to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
The UE shall apply this value in all tracking areas of the list of tracking areas assigned to the UE until a new value is received.
The periodic registration update timer only applies to the UE registered to the 5GS services over 3GPP access. contains an indication that the timer is deactivated or the timer value is zero, then timer T3512 is deactivated and the UE shall not perform the periodic registration update procedure. NOTE1: The UE does not perform the periodic registration update procedure for non-3GPP access. If during the registration procedure, the AMF does not indicate "strictly periodic registration timer supported" in the MICO indication IE to the UE, timer T3512 is reset and started with its initial value, when the UE changes from 5GMM-CONNECTED over 3GPP access to 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access.
Timer T3512 is stopped when the UE enters 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access or the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state over If during the registration procedure, the AMF indicates "strictly periodic registration timer supported" in the MICO indication IE to the UE, timer T3512 is started with its initial value after the completion of the registration procedure.
The UE shall neither stop nor reset the timer T3512 when the UE enters 5GMM-CONNECTED or when changing from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode to 5GMM-IDLE mode.
If the timer T3512 expires, a) the UE in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access shall reset and start the timer T3512 with its initial value; or b) the UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access shall perform the periodic If the UE is registered for emergency services, and timer T3512 expires, shall locally de-register from the network.
When the UE is camping on a suitable cell, it may re-register to regain normal service. expires when the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the periodic registration update procedure shall be started. other than 5GMM-REGISTERED.
NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE over 3GPP access when timer T3512 expires, the periodic registration update procedure is delayed until the UE returns to 5GMM-REGISTERED.
NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE over 3GPP access. NOTE2: When the UE returns to 5GMM-REGISTERED.
NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE and it needs to initiate other 5GMM procedure than the periodic registration update procedure then, based on UE implementation, the 5GMM procedure can take precedence. The network supervises the periodic registration update procedure of the UE by means of the mobile reachable timer. If the UE is not registered for emergency services, the mobile reachable timer shall be longer than the value of timer T351 In this case, by default, the mobile reachable timer is 4 minutes greater than the value The network behaviour upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer is network dependent, but typically the network stops sending paging messages to the UE on the first expiry, and may take other appropriate If the UE is registered for emergency services, the AMF shall set the mobile reachable timer expires, the AMF shall locally de-register the The mobile reachable timer shall be reset and started with the value as indicated above, when the AMF releases the NAS signalling connection for signalling connection is established for the UE. Upon expiry of the mobile reachable timer the network shall start the implicit de-registration timer over 3GPP access.
The value of the implicit de-registration timer over 3GPP access is network dependent.
If MICO mode is activated, the network shall start the implicit de-registration timer over 3GPP access when the UE enters 5GMM-IDLE mode at the AMF over 3GPP access.
The default value of the implicit de-registration timer over 3GPP access is 4 minutes greater than the value of timer T351 If the implicit de-registration timer expires before the UE contacts the network, the network shall implicitly de-register the UE.
The implicit is established for the UE. If the non-3GPP implicit de-registration timer expires before the UE contacts the network over the non-3GPP access, the network shall implicitly de-register the UE and enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED over non-3GPP access for the UE.
The non-3GPP implicit de-registration timer is established for the UE. If the non-3GPP de-registration timer expires before the UE contacts the network over the non-3GPP access, the UE shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED over non-3GPP access.
The non-3GPP de-registration access is established for the UE. If the AMF provides T3346 value IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with Access type set to "Non-3GPP access" in Deregistration type IE, and periodic registration update or SERVICE REJECT message and the value of timer T3346 is greater than the value of timer T3512, the AMF sets the mobile reachable timer and the implicit de-registration timer such that the sum of the timer values is greater than the value of time.
If the AMF provides T3346 value IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with Access type set to "3GPP access" in Deregistration type IE, and periodic registration update or SERVICE REJECT message and the value of timer T3346 is greater than the value of the non-3GPP de-registration timer, the AMF sets the non-3GPP implicit de-registration timer value to be 8 minutes greater than the value of timer T334 If the UE receives T3346 value IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with Access type set to "3GPP access" in Deregistration type IE, and periodic registration update or SERVICE REJECT message and the value of timer T3346 is greater than the value of the non-3GPP de-registration timer, the UE sets the non-3GPP de-registration timer value to be 4 minutes greater than the value of timer T334 Handling of timer T3502 The value of timer T3502 can be sent by the network to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
The UE shall apply this value in all The value of timer T3502 can be sent by the network to the UE in the REGISTRATION REJECT message during the initial registration.
If a REGISTRATION REJECT message including timer T3502 value was received Otherwise, the default value of this timer is used. The default value of this timer is also used by the UE in the following and the 5GS registration type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message is not set to "periodic registration updating”; has been entered, the initial registration procedure fails, the registration attempt counter is equal to 5 and no REGISTRATION REJECT message was received from the new PLMN or SNPN; d) the network indicates that the timer is "deactivated"; or has been entered, the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update fails and the registration attempt counter is equal Handling of NAS level mobility management congestion control The AMF may detect 5GMM signalling congestion and perform general NAS level congestion control.
Under the 5GMM signalling congestion conditions the AMF may reject 5GMM signalling requests from UEs as specified in 3GPPTS201.
The AMF should not reject the a) requests for emergency services; b) requests for emergency services fallback; c) requests from UEs configured for high priority access in selected d) DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message; e) requests for mobile terminated services, triggered by paging or a f) requests for initial registration or mobility and periodic registration update, when emergency is indicated by lower layers; and g) requests for mobility registration update when the UE is reporting unavailability information due to discontinuous coverage. When general NAS level congestion control is active, the AMF may include a value for the mobility management back-off timer T3346 in the reject messages.
The UE starts the timer T3346 with the value received in the 5GMM reject messages.
To avoid that large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the AMF should select the value for the timer T3346 for the rejected UEs so that timeouts are not synchronised. When general NAS level congestion control is active, if the current SNPN is an SNPN selected for localized services in SNPN, the AMF may include an appropriate cause value other than 5GMM cause #22 "congestion" (e.
, #74 "Temporarily not authorized for this SNPN") in the reject messages without including timer T3346 value, to allow the UE to enter state 5GMM-REGISTERED.
PLMN-SEARCH and perform SNPN selection according to 3GPPTS222. If the UE is registered in the same PLMN over the 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, and the UE receives the timer T3346 from the AMF, the timer T3346 shall apply to both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. If the UE receives the paging message or NOTIFICATION message when timer T3346 is running and the UE is registered to the same PLMN over 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, the UE shall stop the timer T3346 for both accesses and respond to the paging message or NOTIFICATION message as specified in subclause and subclause NOTE1: As an implementation option, MUSIM UE is allowed to not respond to paging based on the information available in the paging message, e.
g. If the timer T3346 is running when the UE enters state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then the timer T3346 is kept running until it expires or it is stopped. If the UE is switched off when the timer T3346 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE let t1 be the time remaining for T3346 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on.
If t1 is greater with the value t the new PLMN or SNPN is not equivalent to the PLMN or SNPN where the UE started timer T3346, the UE shall stop timer T3346 when initiating 5GMM procedures in the new PLMN or SNPN. 5GS update status is 5U1 UPDATED then the UE shall set the 5GS update status to 5U2 NOT UPDATED and enter state If timer T3346 is running or is deactivated, and: b) the UE needs to initiate signalling for emergency services or emergency services fallback; or c) the UE needs to report unavailability information due to then the UE is allowed to initiate 5GMM procedures. NOTE2: UE can, based on implementation, restrict lower layers of non-3GPP access from establishing access stratum connection on a registered PLMN when timer T3346 is running for the same PLMN. 0 Handling of DNN based congestion control The AMF may detect and start performing DNN based congestion control when one or more DNN congestion criteria as specified in non-emergency PDU session, then the AMF uses the selected DNN or the DNN associated with the PDU session corresponding to the 5GSM procedure. When DNN based congestion control is activated at the AMF, the AMF performs the congestion control as specified in subclause and the UE performs the congestion control as specified in subclause and 1 Handling of S-NSSAI based congestion control The AMF may detect and start performing S-NSSAI based congestion control when one or more S-NSSAI congestion criteria as specified in non-emergency PDU session, then the AMF uses the selected DNN or the DNN associated with the PDU session corresponding to the 5GSM procedure.
If the AMF uses the selected S-NSSAI or the S-NSSAI associated with the PDU session corresponding to the 5GSM procedure. The AMF may detect and start performing S-NSSAI based congestion control when the UE that does not support S-NSSAI location validity information and the UE is not in the NS-AoS. When S-NSSAI based congestion control is activated at the AMF, the AMF performs the congestion control as specified in subclause and the UE performs the congestion control as specified in subclause and 2 Handling of local emergency numbers supporting registration or attach procedures via 3GPP access and registration procedures via non-3GPP access. an extended local emergency numbers list or both, in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, by including the Emergency number list IE and the Extended emergency number list IE, respectively.
The Local emergency numbers list can be updated as described in 3GPPTS201, In case of SNPN, the network may send an extended local emergency numbers list, in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, by including the Extended emergency number list IE.
The network shall set the Extended Emergency Number List Validity (EENLV) field within the Extended emergency number list IE to "Extended Local Emergency Numbers List is valid only in the PLMN from which this IE is received".
The UE shall consider the emergency number(s) received in the Extended emergency number list IE valid only in the SNPN from which this IE is received regardless of the received value of the EENLV field within the Extended emergency number list IE. The UE shall store the local emergency numbers list and the extended local emergency numbers list, as provided by the network.

The local emergency numbers list and the extended local emergency numbers list shall be deleted at switch off or removal of the USIM.
The UE shall be able to store up to ten entries in the local emergency numbers list and up to twenty entries in the Extended local emergency numbers list, received from the network. For the use of the local emergency numbers list and the extended local emergency numbers list by the UE see 3GPPTS201, 2A Handling of local emergency numbers received via 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.

The UE shall not remove the tracking area from "5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming" or "5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service" if the UE is registered for emergency services. In N1 mode over 3GPP access, the UE shall update the suitable list message is received with the 5GMM cause #12 "tracking area not allowed", #13 "roaming not allowed in this tracking area", #15 "no suitable cells in tracking area", or #62 "no network slices available". In N1 mode over 3GPP access, if the UE receives the "5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming" IE or the "5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE in the REGISTRATION REJECT, SERVICE REJECT, DEREGISTRATION REQUEST, REGISTRATION ACCEPT or SERVICE ACCEPT message, the UE update the suitable list with the received TAI(s) belonging to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) and ignore the TAI(s) which do not belong to the serving PLMN or equivalent PLMN(s) included in the IE. If the UE receives ACTIVATE DEFAULT EPS BEARER CONTEXT REQUEST message provided with S-NSSAI and the PLMN ID in the Protocol configuration options IE or Extended protocol configuration options IE (see subclause of 3GPPTS201), the UE may remove the corresponding tracking area from the "5GS forbidden tracking areas for Over wireline access, the 5G-RG, the W-AGF acting on behalf of an FN-RG or the W-AGF acting on behalf of an N5GC device shall update the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is received with the 5GMM cause #12 "tracking area not allowed" or #13 "roaming not allowed in this tracking NOTE: In this release of the specification, for untrusted non-3GPP access and trusted non-3GPP access, neither the list of "5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming" nor the list of "5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service" is maintained by the UE since the UE is not able to determine the corresponding TAI. Each list shall accommodate 40 or more TAIs.
When the list is full and a new entry has to be inserted, the oldest entry shall be deleted. 3A Forbidden PLMN lists In N1 mode, two lists of forbidden PLMN are managed independently per access type, i.
, 3GPP access or non-3GPP access: the list of "forbidden PLMNs" as defined in 3GPPTS222 is applicable for 3GPP access in N1 mode.
The same list is used by 5GMM for 3GPP access, EMM, GMM and MM (see 3GPPTS201 and 3GPPTS208), regardless whether the UE is operating in single-registration mode or dual-registration mode. the list of "forbidden PLMNs for non-3GPP access to 5GCN" as defined in 3GPP specification document is applicable for 5GMM for non-3GPP access. The list of "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" as defined in 3GPPTS222 and 3GPPTS208 is applicable for 3GPP access in N1 mode.
The same list is used by 5GMM for 3GPP access, EMM and GMM (see 3GPPTS201 and 3GPPTS208), regardless whether the UE is operating in single-registration mode or dual-registration The forbidden PLMN lists shall be maintained across activation and deactivation of SNPN access operation mode. NOTE: On timer T3245 expiry when the UE supports access to an SNPN using UE is operating in SNPN access operation mode, as an implementation option the UE can delete the list of "forbidden PLMNs", "forbidden PLMNs for non-3GPP access to 5GCN" and "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service". 4 List of equivalent PLMNs regarded by the UE as equivalent to each other for PLMN selection and cell selection/re-selection.
The same list is used by 5GMM, EMM, GMM and MM (see 3GPPTS201 and 3GPPTS208) except for the case when the UE operates in dual-registration mode (see subclause). The UE shall update or delete this list at the end of each registration downloaded by the network plus the PLMN code of the registered PLMN that downloaded the list.
When the UE is switched off, the UE shall keep the stored list so that it can be used for PLMN selection after switch on. The UE shall delete the stored list if the USIM is removed or when the UE registered for emergency services enters the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED. The maximum number of possible entries in the stored list is 1 If the UE registers to different PLMNs over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, the UE shall store an additional list of equivalent PLMNs associated with non-3GPP access.
The UE manages the two lists of equivalent PLMNs per access type independently. 4A List of equivalent SNPNs The UE may support equivalent SNPNs. per entry of "list of subscriber data"; or per the PLMN subscription, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using SNPNs in the list of equivalent SNPNs associated with the selected entry of "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription shall be regarded by the UE as equivalent to each other for SNPN selection, cell selection and cell re-selection. The list of equivalent SNPNs associated with the selected entry of "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription is created, replaced or deleted at the end of each registration procedure.
The network plus the SNPN identity of the registered SNPN that provided the When the UE is switched off, the UE shall keep the stored list(s) so that they can be used for SNPN selection after switch on. The UE shall delete the stored list associated with an entry of "list of subscriber data" or the PLMN subscription, when the USIM is removed, the associated entry of "list of subscriber data" is updated, or the UE registered for emergency services enters the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED. The maximum number of possible entries in each stored list is 1 NOTE1: To enable UE mobility between the registered SNPN and an equivalent SNPN, the SNPN identity of the registered SNPN providing a list of equivalent SNPNs and the SNPN identity(ies) in the list of equivalent SNPNs are assumed to be globally-unique SNPN identities. NOTE2: The MS can provide the list of equivalent SNPNs associated with the selected entry of "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription to the lower layers. If the UE supports equivalent SNPNs and registers to different SNPNs over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, the UE shall store an additional list of equivalent SNPNs associated with non-3GPP access.
The UE manages the two lists of equivalent SNPNs per access type independently. 5 Transmission failure abnormal case in the UE The abnormal case 5GMM uplink message transmission failure indication by lower layers can be identified for 5GMM procedures: When it is specified in the relevant procedure that it is up to the UE implementation to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered that procedure, the procedure can typically be re-initiated using a retransmission mechanism of the uplink message (i.
the one that has previously failed to be transmitted) with new sequence number and message authentication code information thus avoiding to re-start the NOTE: The transmission failure can happen due to TAI change.
The lower layer might take some time to read the system information and determine if the current TAI is changed.
Therefore, the information of TAI change failure indication from the lower layer.
How to handle the retransmission procedure caused by the possible delayed TAI change information is up to UE implementation. 6 Extended DRX cycle for UEs in 5GMM-IDLE and 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication requested by the UE and accepted by the network: if the UE is not in NB-N1 mode, eDRX is used when the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode or in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode with RRC inactive indication; if the UE is in NB-N1 mode, eDRX is used when the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE by including the Requested extended DRX parameters IE (see 3GPPTS201 and 3GPPTS202).
The UE shall not request the UE may use the extended idle mode DRX cycle length stored in the USIM (see 3GPPTS302) when requesting the use of eDRX. The UE and the network may negotiate eDRX parameters during a registration procedure when the UE has an emergency PDU session. The network accepts the request to use the eDRX by providing the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE when accepting the registration procedure.
The UE shall use eDRX only if it received the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure and the UE does not have an emergency PDU session. NOTE1: If the UE wants to keep using eDRX, the UE includes the Extended DRX parameters IE in each registration procedure. If the UE received the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure, upon successful completion of the PDU session release procedure of the emergency PDU session, the UE shall If the network has provided the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure, upon successful completion of the PDU session release procedure of the emergency PDU session, the network shall resume eDRX. If the UE or the network locally releases an emergency PDU session, the UE or the network shall not use eDRX until the UE receives eDRX procedure with PDU session context synchronization. If the UE did not receive the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE, or if the UE has an emergency PDU session, the UE shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available. If the network did not accept the request to use eDRX, or if the UE has an emergency PDU session, the network shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available. If the network provided the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE and subclause during the last registration procedure, the network shall use the stored UE specific DRX parameter, if available, with the old 5G-GUTI and use the eDRX provided by the network with the new 5G-GUTI until the old 5G-GUTI can be considered as invalid by the network (see subclauses and). NOTE2: If the UE using eDRX has joined one or more multicast MBS sessions or wants to receive the traffic of broadcast MBS sessions, the upper layers of the UE provide the lower layers with the MBS start time and the scheduled activation times of the respective MBS session if any of those times are obtained via the service announcement as specified in 3GPPTS247.
This interaction between the upper layers and the lower layers is out of scope of the present document..
7 Service Gap Control Service gap control (SGC) only applies to 3GPP access. The network may control the frequency with which UEs can transition from 5GMM-IDLE mode to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode via the SGC as specified in 3GPPTS201 and 3GPPTS202.
If the network supports SGC and the service gap time value i.
T3447 value is available in the 5GMM context of the UE, the AMF shall consider SGC as active for the UE. The UE and the network negotiate usage of SGC during the registration procedure for initial registration and registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update: the UE supporting SGC indicates its support in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the UE supports SGC and the SGC is active for the UE, the AMF includes T3447 value IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message (see subclause and subclause).
The UE stores the T3447 for UEs that do not support SGC when the network rejects mobility management signalling requests because SGC is active in the network, the mechanism for general NAS level mobility management congestion control as specified in subclause applies. it is started or stop timer T3447 in the UE if running with the Generic UE configuration update procedure as specified in subclause The UE shall start timer T3447 when the N1 NAS signalling connection is the UE supports SGC, and the T3447 value is available in the UE and does not indicate zero; and the N1 NAS signalling connection released was not established for: registration procedure for initial registration with Follow-on request indicator set to "No follow-on request pending"; registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update with Follow-on request indicator set to "No follow-on request pending" and without Uplink data status IE included; requests for emergency services; or requests for exception data reporting. If the SGC is active in the network, after the UE transitions from 5GMM-CONNECTED mode to 5GMM-IDLE mode except when the UE was in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode due to: registration procedure for initial registration with Follow-on request indicator set to "No follow-on request pending"; registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update with Follow-on request indicator set to "No follow-on request pending" and without Uplink data status IE included, requests for emergency services; or requests for exception data reporting, the network shall start timer T3447 if not already running: with the T3447 value available in the 5GMM context minus 4 minutes, if the UE supports SGC and the T3447 value has been sent to the UE with a with the T3447 value available in the 5GMM context if the UE does not When timer T3447 is running, the network allows: requests for emergency service; requests for emergency services fallback; requests for high priority access; requests for exception data reporting; registration procedure for initial registration with Follow-on request indicator set to "No follow-on request pending"; registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update without Uplink data status IE included and with Follow-on request indicator set to "No follow-on request pending"; or service request procedure or registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update triggered by paging and subsequent MO signalling or MO data, if any, until the UE enters 5GMM-IDLE mode. when the UE transits from 5GMM-IDLE mode to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode. NOTE: If the UE transitions from 5GMM-IDLE mode to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode due to registration procedure for initial registration with Follow-on request indicator set to "No follow-on request pending" or mobility and periodic registration update request without Uplink data status IE and with Follow-on request indicator set to "No follow-on request pending", the UE initiates no further MO signalling except for mobility and periodic registration update requests without Uplink data status and with Follow-on request indicator set to "No follow-on request pending" until the UE receives mobile terminated signalling (e.
DL NAS TRANSPORT message for MT SMS) or MT data over user plane, or after the UE has moved to 5GMM-IDLE state and the service gap timer is not If timer T3447 is running when the UE changes PLMN or enters state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED, the UE remains switched on, and the USIM in the UE remains the same, then timer T3447 is kept running until it expires. If the AMF determines that the UE operating in single-registration mode has performed an inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode and the timer T3447 is running in the AMF, the AMF stops the T344 Upon inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, if the UE supports service gap control, T3447 is running in the UE, and the T3447 value IE is included in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message received from the AMF (see subclause and subclause), the UE shall keep T3447 running.
Additionally, the UE shall store and replace the currently stored service gap time value with the received T3447 value.
Upon expiry of the running T3447 timer, the UE shall use the new value when starting If the UE is switched off when the timer T3447 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE let t1 be the time remaining for timer T3447 timeout at switch off and greater thant, then the timer shall be restarted with the value t1 – t. timer with the value t 8 Restriction on use of enhanced coverage In order to deal with use of extensive resources from the network, the operator may prevent specific subscribers from using enhanced coverage (see 3GPPTS201).
When in NB-N1 mode, the UE shall indicate support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage.
When in WB-N1 mode, for restriction on use of enhanced coverage.
The UE supporting restriction on use of enhanced coverage indicates its support for restriction on use of enhanced coverage in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the UE supports restriction on use of enhanced coverage, the AMF indicates in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message (see subclause b) when in NB-N1 mode, whether the use of enhanced coverage is restricted or not for the UE..
a) the use of enhanced coverage is restricted; the UE shall not use enhanced coverage in the registered PLMN and in any PLMN which is in the list of equivalent PLMNs. a) the use of enhanced coverage is not restricted for the UE; or the applicable NAS timer values shall be calculated by the network as described in subclause9 and subclause as described in 3GPPTS201; and b) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode and there is no ongoing registration the AMF shall initiate the generic UE configuration update procedure to indicate registration requested and release of the N1 NAS signalling connection not requested as described in subclause After the successful completion of the registration procedure for mobility registration update including change of the restriction on the use of enhanced coverage, for any SMF with which the UE has an established PDU session, the AMF updates the SMF with the indication on the use of extended NAS timer setting as described in 3GPPTS201 and 9 Handling of congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane The network may activate congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, as specified in 3GPPTS201. If the UE has indicated support for the control plane CIoT 5GS optimizations and the network decides to activate the congestion control for transport of user data via the control plane, the network may REGISTRATION ACCEPT, SERVICE ACCEPT or SERVICE REJECT message, and shall starts the timer T3448 with the value informed in the message.
To avoid that large numbers of UEs simultaneously initiate deferred requests, the network should select the value for the timer T3448 for the informed UEs so that timeouts are not synchronised. The network sends REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or SERVICE ACCEPT message without T3448 value IE to stop the timer T3448 running in the UE as specified in subclause and subclause Based on the stored control plane data back-off time for the UE, the network may reject the transfer of user data via the control plane initiated by the UE. While the timer T3448 is running, the UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode does not initiate the transport of user data via the control plane procedure, except if the UE is allowed to use exception data reporting (see the ExceptionDataReportingAllowed leaf of the NAS configuration MO in 3GPPTS268 or the USIM file EF_(NASCONFIG) in 3GPPTS302) and the user data is related to an exceptional The UE is allowed: a) to respond to paging with CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message without uplink data; or services or for emergency services fallback; even if the timer T3448 is running. equivalent to the PLMN where the UE started the timer T3448, or upon being switched off while the timer T3448 is running, the UE stops the 9A Specific requirements for UE configured to use timer T3245 9A.
1 UE not operating in SNPN access operation mode the USIM as invalid for 5GS services for 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, and timer T3245 (see 3GPPTS208) is not running, the UE shall start timer T3245 as specified in 3GPPTS208, Upon expiry of the timer T3245, the UE shall erase the "forbidden PLMN list" and "forbidden PLMNs for GPRS service" list and set the USIM to valid for 5GS services for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
When the lists are erased, the UE performs cell selection according to If the UE is switched off when the timer T3245 is running, the UE shall behave as follows when the UE is switched on and the USIM in the UE let t1 be the time remaining for T3245 timeout at switch off and let t be the time elapsed between switch off and switch on.
If t1 is greater defined in the paragraph above upon expiry of the timer T324 If the UE with the value t 9A.
2 UE operating in SNPN access operation mode When the UE adds an SNPN to the "permanently forbidden SNPNs" list or "temporarily forbidden SNPNs" list which are, if the MS supports access or both, associated with the selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription, or sets the selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription as invalid for 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, and timer T3245 (see 3GPPTS208) is not running, the UE shall start timer T3245 with a random value, uniformly drawn from the range between 12h and 24h. When the UE adds an SNPN to the "permanently forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN" list or "temporarily forbidden SNPNs for access for localized services in SNPN" list which are associated with the selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription for 3GPP access or non-3GPP access, and timer T3245 is not a) if there is no next valid time period for the SNPN, the UE shall between 12h and 24h; or b) if there is next valid time period for the SNPN, the UE shall start the start time point and the end time point of the next valid time period for localized services in SNPN. NOTE1: The random value to calculate the value of timer T3245 can be UE implementation-specific value for the UE to perform SNPN selection for localized services in SNPN and receive localized services in the SNPN before the valid time of localized services ends. Upon expiry of the timer T3245, the UE shall erase the "permanently forbidden SNPNs" list(s) and "temporarily forbidden SNPNs" list(s) and set the selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription to valid for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.

A UE supporting CIoT 5GS optimizations can indicate the 5GS CIoT network behaviour the UE can support and prefers to use during the registration procedure (see 3GPPTS202).
The UE may indicate the support for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization, user plane CIoT 5GS optimization, N3 data transfer and header compression (see subclause).
Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization or user plane CIoT 5GS optimization (see subclauseA).
The indication of preference is also considered as the request to use.
A UE supporting CIoT EPS optimizations can also indicate the EPS CIoT network behaviour the UE can support during the registration procedure.
Furthermore, the UE may, separately from the indication of support, indicate preference for control plane CIoT EPS optimization or user plane CIoT EPS optimization. NOTE1: CIoT 5GS optimizations are not supported by NR connected to NOTE2: If the UE does not support user plane CIoT 5GS optimization, it does not indicate preference for user plane CIoT 5GS optimization. The UE can be in NB-N1 mode or WB-N1 mode when requesting the use of CIoT 5GS optimizations during the registration procedure.
A UE in NB-N1 mode always indicates support for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization. In NB-N1 mode, the UE, when requesting the use of CIoT 5GS request an initial registration for emergency services; indicate UE's usage setting during the registration procedure. The network does not indicate to the UE support of emergency services when the UE is in NB-N1 mode (see subclause and\). The control plane CIoT 5GS optimization enables support of efficient transport of user data (IP, Ethernet and Unstructured) or SMS messages over control plane via the AMF without triggering user-plane resources establishment.
The support of control plane CIoT 5GS optimization is mandatory for the network in NB-N1 mode and optional in WB-N1 mode. Optional header compression of IP data and Ethernet data can be applied to PDU sessions with IP PDU session type and Ethernet PDU session type that are configured to support header compression.
For IP header compression, Robust Header Compression (ROHC) protocol specified in IETFRFC5795[39B] is used.
For Ethernet header compression, Ethernet Header Compression (EHC) protocol specified in 3GPP specification document is in N1 mode, the control plane CIoT 5GS optimization also enables the transport of location services messages from 5GMM-IDLE mode using the CONTROL PLANE SERVICE REQUEST message when location services are requested (see subclause in 3GPPTS273[6B]). The user plane CIoT 5GS optimization enables support for change from 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access without the need for using the service request procedure (see If the UE supports user plane CIoT 5GS optimization, it shall also support N3 data transfer. If the UE indicates support of one or more CIoT 5GS optimizations and the network supports one or more CIoT 5GS optimizations and decides to accept the registration request, the network indicates the supported CIoT 5GS optimizations to the UE per registration area when accepting the UE request.
Network indication of support is interpreted by the UE as the acceptance to use the respective feature.
After completion of the registration procedure, the UE and the network can then use the accepted CIoT 5GS optimizations for the transfer of user data (IP, Ethernet, A UE in NB-N1 mode or WB-N1 mode can request the use of SMS over NAS by setting the SMS requested bit of the 5GS update type IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message as specified in subclauses and NB-N1 mode or WB-N1 mode by setting the SMS allowed bit of the 5GS registration result IE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message as specified If the UE and the network support both the control plane CIoT 5GS optimization and N3 data transfer, then when receiving the UE's request should be NEF PDU session or N6 PDU session as specified in a) if NEF PDU session is to be established for unstructured data type, the AMF includes control plane only indication for the requested PDU session to the SMF; b) if N6 PDU session is to be established and the DNN or S-NSSAI of the newly requested N6 PDU session supports interworking with EPS as 1) if there are existing N6 PDU sessions supporting interworking with EPS for this UE that were established with the control plane only indication, the AMF includes the control plane only indication for the newly requested N6 PDU session to the SMF; or 2) if there are existing N6 PDU sessions supporting interworking with EPS for this UE that were established without the control plane only indication, the AMF does not include the control plane only indication for the newly requested N6 PDU session to the SMF; 3) if there is no existing N6 PDU session supporting interworking with EPS for this UE, the AMF determines whether to include the control plane only indication for the newly requested N6 PDU session to the SMF based on local policies, the UE's preferred CIoT network behaviour and the supported CIoT network behaviour; and c) if N6 PDU session is to be established and the DNN or S-NSSAI of the N6 PDU session does not support interworking with EPS as specified in 3GPPTS202, the AMF determines whether to include the control plane only indication for the newly requested N6 PDU session to the SMF based on local policies, the UE's preferred CIoT network behaviour and the supported CIoT network behaviour. In NB-N1 mode, if the UE or the network does not support N3 data establishment, the AMF decides whether the PDU session should be NEF PDU session or N6 PDU session as specified in 3GPPTS201 and then includes the control plane only indication for the requested PDU session If the network supports user plane CIoT 5GS optimization, it shall also support N3 data transfer. Broadcast system information may provide information about support of CIoT 5GS optimizations (see 3GPPTS331[25A]).
At reception of new broadcast system information, the lower layers deliver it to the 5GMM layer in the UE.
The information provided by lower layers is per PLMN and used by the UE to determine whether certain CIoT 5GS optimizations are supported in the cell. The UE shall not attempt to use CIoT 5GS optimizations which are indicated as not supported. In NB-N1 mode, at any given time, there cannot be user-plane resources number of supported user-plane resources.
The UE in NB-N1 mode shall sessions that exceeds the UE' s maximum number of supported user-plane 1) the UE has indicated preference for user plane CIoT 5GS optimization; 2) the network accepted the use of user plane CIoT 5GS optimization; and 3) the UE currently has user-plane resources established fora number of PDU sessions that is equal to the UE' s maximum number of supported number of supported user-plane resources as follows: resources when the Multiple user-plane resources support bit is set to "Multiple user-plane resources not supported", or resources when the Multiple user-plane resources support bit is set to "Multiple user-plane resources supported". that is the default QoS rule.
Reflective QoS is not supported in NB-N1 connection and the UE requests the use of user plane CIoT 5GS optimization, the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT 5GS optimizations to the lower layers.
If the UE requests the use of N3 data transfer without user plane CIoT 5GS optimization, then the UE shall also pass an indication of user plane CIoT 5GS optimization to lower connection and the UE requests the use of control plane CIoT 5GS optimization or user plane CIoT 5GS optimization, the UE shall pass an indication of the requested CIoT 5GS optimizations to the lower layers. 2 Interaction between MICO mode with active time and extended idle mode DRX cycle The UE can request the use of both MICO mode with active time and eDRX enable none, one of them or both (see 3GPPTS201). If the network accepts the use of both MICO mode with active time (see subclause) and eDRX (see subclause6), the extended DRX parameters provided to the UE should allow for multiple paging occasions before the active timer expires. 3 Forbidden wireline access area 5GMM cause #77 "wireline access area not allowed", if conditions specified in 3GPPTS216[6D] for AMF's enforcement of forbidden area #77 "wireline access area not allowed": a) the 5G-RG shall not access 5GCN over the wireline access network until the 5G-RG is switched off, the UICC containing the USIM is removed, or the 5G-RG starts using another wireline access network; NOTE: When the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device receives a REGISTRATION REJECT, SERVICE REJECT or DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message area not allowed", the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device can prevent reattempt of the same procedure until the AUN3 device is switched off or the UICC containing the USIM of the AUN3 device is b) the W-AGF acting on behalf of the FN-CRG shall not access 5GCN until the W-AGF acting on behalf of the FN-CRG determines that the FN-CRG is c) the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall not access 5GCN until the W-AGF acting on behalf of the FN-CRG determines that the FN-CRG serving the N5GC device is switched off. A UE supporting reception of WUS assistance information indicates its capability for reception of WUS assistance information during registration procedure (see 3GPPTS201).
The UE supporting WUS assistance information may include its UE paging probability information in the Requested WUS assistance information IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message (see 3GPPTS201).
The UE shall not include its UE paging probability information during: a) a registration procedure for initial registration for emergency b) a registration procedure for initial registration for initiating an emergency PDU session (see subclause); c) a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see subclause) for initiating an emergency PDU session if the UE is in the state d) a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update (see subclause) when the UE has an emergency PDU session The UE and the network may negotiate the UE paging probability emergency PDU session.
The UE paging probability information is an assistance information used to determine the WUS group for paging UE NOTE1: The determination of UE paging probability information is up to Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure due to an active emergency PDU session over 3GPP access, the registration update to request WUS assistance information after the emergency PDU session is released over 3GPP access. If the UE does not have an emergency PDU session and the network accepts the use of the WUS assistance information for the UE, the network determines the negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE based on the requested UE paging probability information, if any, local configuration or previous statistical information for the UE, and then indicates the negotiated UE paging probability information in the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE to the UE in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message.
The network shall store the negotiated UE paging probability information in the 5GMM context of the UE for paging. The UE shall use WUS assistance information only if the UE received the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure.
If the UE did not receive the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure, the UE shall delete any existing WUS assistance information received from the If the network did not accept the request to use WUS assistance information, the network shall delete the stored negotiated UE paging probability information for the UE, if available. When an emergency PDU session is successfully established after the UE received the Negotiated WUS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure, the UE and the AMF shall not use WUS assistance the successful completion of the PDU session release procedure of the procedure with PDU session status IE or upon successful completion of a service request procedure, if the UE or the network locally releases the emergency PDU session; or the successful completion of the handover of the emergency PDU session NOTE2: WUS assistance is not supported by NR connected to 5GCN. 5 Paging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping Assistance A UE may indicate its capability to support NR paging subgrouping during registration procedure when the UE: set to "emergency registration"; and does not have an active emergency PDU session. NOTE: The requirements for UE-ID based PEI are specified in to support NR paging subgrouping during the last registration procedure due to an active emergency PDU session over 3GPP access, the UE shall update procedure to indicate its capability to support NR paging subgrouping after the emergency PDU session is released over 3GPP If the UE indicates support of NR paging subgrouping the UE may include its paging probability information in the Requested PEIPS assistance information IE in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message.
If the UE indicates support of NR paging subgrouping and the network supports and accepts the use of the PEIPS assistance information for the UE, the network provides to the UE the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information, including the Paging subgroup ID, in the REGISTRATION ACCEPT message or the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
The Paging subgroup ID is used to determine the NR paging subgroup for paging the UE.
The UE NAS layer shall indicate the Paging subgroup ID to the access stratum layer.
The network shall store the Paging subgroup ID in the 5GMM context of the The UE shall use PEIPS assistance information only if the UE received the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure.
If the UE did not receive the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure, the UE shall delete any existing PEIPS assistance information received from the If the network did not accept the request to use PEIPS assistance information during the registration procedure, the network shall delete the stored PEIPS assistance information for the UE, if available. If the UE supports the use of the PEIPS assistance information and the network supports and accepts the use of the PEIPS assistance information, the network may provide the PEIPS assistance information to the UE by including the Updated PEIPS assistance information IE in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message. When an emergency PDU session is successfully established over 3GPP access after the UE received the Negotiated PEIPS assistance information IE during the last registration procedure, the UE and the AMF shall not use PEIPS assistance information until: the successful completion of the PDU session release procedure of the procedure with PDU session status IE or upon successful completion of a service request procedure, if the UE or the network locally releases the the successful completion of handover of emergency PDU session to the successful transfer of the emergency PDU session in 5GS to the EPS or ePDG connected to EPC. 6 Support for unavailability period If the UE and network support unavailability period and an event is time, the UE may store its 5GMM and 5GSM context in USIM or non-volatile memory in the ME to be able to reuse it after the unavailability period. NOTE1: How and where the UE stores its contexts depends upon the UE implementation.
The UE can store some or all of its contexts in the ME or USIM using existing ME or USIM functionality. To activate the unavailability period, the UE provides unavailability period duration if known, and the start of the unavailability period if known, during the registration procedure or during the de-registration procedure (see 3GPPTS201 and 3GPPTS202).
The support for the unavailability period is negotiated in the registration cell, the AMF may provide the unavailability period duration of the UE during the registration procedure.
The AMF may consider the unavailability period duration provided by the UE if available and determine the unavailability period duration of the UE as described in If the UE provided unavailability information in the last registration procedure or de-registration procedure, the AMF considers the UE of the unavailability period, the AMF shall consider the start of the unavailability period to be the time at which AMF received the REGISTRATION REQUEST message or the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message from the UE.
During the registration procedure, the AMF may determine the values of the negotiated extended DRX parameters, the timer T3324, and the periodic registration update timer (T3512) to be provided to the UE based on the unavailability period duration and the start of the unavailability period based on their availability.
The AMF should set the value of the mobile reachable timer and implicit de-registration timer based on the unavailability period duration and the start of the unavailability period.
The AMF releases the N1 signalling connection after the completion of the registration procedure in which the UE provided unavailability information without providing the start of the NOTE2: If the UE supports MUSIM and the UE and the networks the UE is registered with support the unavailability period, then the UE can maximum time offset as described in subclause, , and , the UE shall set the discontinuous coverage maximum time discontinuous coverage maximum time offset for this PLMN and satellite about to lose satellite coverage minus the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset value, and send the REGISTRATION REQUEST message for mobility registration update to the AMF indicating out of coverage at the determined time point. described in subclause, , and , upon returning coverage due to discontinuous coverage, and in the last REGISTRATION ACCEPT message the end of unavailability period report was set to "UE needs to report end of unavailability period", the UE shall start the to and including the stored maximum time offset value, if available, for this PLMN and NR satellite access, and starts the discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer.
The UE shall enter 5GMM-REGISTERED.
ATTEMPTING-REGISTRATION-UPDATE state and shall not initiate any NAS signalling on that NR satellite access and PLMN while the maximum time offset timer is running.
The UE shall stop the maximum time offset timer and initiate NAS signalling if the UE receives paging message, has pending emergency services, is establishing an emergency PDU session or is performing emergency services fallback procedure or discontinuous coverage maximum time offset timer the UE shall perform a registration procedure for mobility registration update. If the end of unavailability period report indicates "UE does not need to report end of unavailability period" then upon returning in coverage appropriate substate of 5GMM-REGISTERED and does not need to perform a registration procedure for mobility registration update due to end of If for discontinuous coverage the AMF sets the End of unavailability report bit in Unavailability configuration IE value to “UE does not need to report end of unavailability”, the UE is not required to trigger the registration procedure for mobility registration update when the unavailability period duration has ended.
If the AMF does not provide the Unavailability configuration IE or the AMF sets the End of unavailability report bit in Unavailability configuration IE value to “UE needs to report end of unavailability”, the UE should trigger registration procedure for mobility registration update when the unavailability period duration has ended. When the unavailability period is activated, all NAS timers are stopped and associated procedures aborted except for timers T3512, T3346, T3447, T controlling the periodic search for HPLMN or EHPLMN or higher prioritized PLMNs, and the timer T_(SENSE) controlling the periodic search for PLMNs satisfying the operator controlled signal level When the UE activates the unavailability period using registration procedure without providing the start of the unavailability period, then after successful completion of the procedure the UE shall enter the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.
NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and may deactivate AS layer. Otherwise, if the UE provided the start of unavailability period in the registration procedure, the UE shall enter the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.
NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and may deactivate AS layer only after the UE activates the unavailability period. When the UE activates the unavailability period using the de-registration procedure, then after successful completion of the procedure the UE shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED.
NO-CELL-AVAILABLE and deactivate the AS layer. When the UE comes out of the unavailability period the UE shall activate the AS layer if deactivated and perform registration procedure as described in subclause and Primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
The purpose of the primary authentication and key agreement procedure is to enable mutual authentication between the UE and the network and to provide keying material that can be used between the UE and network in subsequent security procedures, as specified in 3GPPTS301. Two methods are defined: a) EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure. b) 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure. The UE and the AMF shall support the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure. EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
The purpose of the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is to provide mutual authentication between the UE and the network and to agree on the keys K_(AUSF), K_(SEAF) and K_(AMF) (see Extensible authentication protocol (EAP) as specified in IETFRFC3748 enables authentication using various EAP methods. EAP defines four types of EAP messages: a) an EAP-request message; b) an EAP-response message; c) an EAP-success message; and d) an EAP-failure message. EAP-response message can be required to achieve the authentication (see The EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network. The EAP-request message, the ngKSI and the ABBA are transported from the network to the UE using the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message of the EAP message reliable transport procedure. The EAP-response message is transported from the UE to the network using the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message of the EAP message reliable If the authentication of the UE completes successfully, the serving AMF based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the security mode control procedure intends to bring into use the partial native 5G NAS security context created by the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, then the EAP-success message and the ngKSI are transported from the network to the UE using the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message of the security mode control procedure If the authentication of the UE completes successfully and the serving bringing into use the partial native 5G NAS security context created by the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, then the EAP-success message, and the ngKSI are transported from the network to the UE using the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the EAP result procedure after the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure e.
in case of AMF relocation during registration procedure. If the authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully, the EAP-failure message is transported from the network to the UE using the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of initial 5GMM procedure as part of which the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is performed. The AMF shall set the authenticator retransmission timer specified in IETFRFC3748 subclause to infinite value. transport of EAP messages and therefore retransmissions at the EAP layer The AUSF and the AMF support exchange of EAP messages using N1 The UE shall detect and handle any duplication of EAP message as Figure: EAP based primary authentication and key agreement.

Upon receiving an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an EAP-request message from the network, the UE shall stop timer T3520, if running, and then process the EAP-request message as normally. If the network does not accept the client certificate of the UE, the network handling depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in the initial NAS message, that is: if the 5G-GUTI was used; or if the SUCI was used. If the 5G-GUTI was used, the network should transport the EAP-failure message in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the EAP result message transport procedure, initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE and restart the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received SUCI. If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE after an unsuccessful the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, the network should transport the EAP-failure message in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message transport procedure. Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency registration type IE set to "emergency registration" and the AMF is configured to allow emergency registration without user identity, the AMF needs not follow the procedures specified for transporting the EAP-failure message in the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message transport procedure in the present subclause.

The N5GC device can inform the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device that the N5GC device fails to authenticate the network.
Details of communication between the N5GC device and the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device are out of scope of this When initiating an EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using such EAP method, the network shall select an ngKSI value.
The network shall send the selected ngKSI value to the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device along with each EAP message.
The network shall send the ABBA value as described in subclause0 to the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device along with the EAP-request message and EAP-success message.
The W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall not forward the ngKSI value or the ABBA value to the N5GC NOTE3: The network provides the ngKSI value and the ABBA value since the ngKSI IE and the ABBA IE are mandatory IEs in AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
The W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device does not use the ngKSI value or the ABBA value provided by the network. If the N5GC device fails to authenticate the network, the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall start timer T3520 when the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the EAP-response message is sent.
Furthermore, the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.
T3510, T3517 or T3521).
Upon receiving an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an EAP-request message from the network, the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall stop timer T3520, if running, and then provides the EAP-request message to the N5GC device as If the network fails to authenticate the N5GC device, the network handling depends upon the type of identity used by the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device in the initial NAS message, that is: a) if the 5G-GUTI was used; or b) if the SUCI was used. If the 5G-GUTI was used, the network should transport the EAP-failure message in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the EAP result message transport procedure, initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device and restart the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device after an unsuccessful EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, the network should transport the EAP-failure message in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message of the EAP result message If the EAP-failure message is received in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall start timer minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is not running (see subclause0).
Additionally, the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC a) if the counter for "USIM considered invalid for 5GS services over implementation-specific maximum value, proceed as specified in list item 1)-b) of subclause for the case that the 5GMM cause value received is #3; or b) otherwise, set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete the stored 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and ngKSI.
The USIM shall be considered invalid for 5GS services via non-3GPP access until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device, the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall abort any 5GMM signalling procedure, stop any of the timers T3510, 5GMM-DEREGISTERED and delete any stored SUCI. Upon receiving an EAP-success message, the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall consider the procedure complete. Upon receiving an EAP-failure message, the W-AGF acting on behalf of the N5GC device shall consider the procedure complete.

EAP-AKA' and EAP-TLS are examples of such EAP method. The AUSF supporting authentication of the AUN3 device shall support acting as EAP server of at least one such EAP method as specified in The 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device provides to the AUN3 device an EAP-request message, an EAP-success message or an EAP-failure message received from the network according to subclause and sends to the network according to subclause an EAP-response provided by the AUN3 device.
Details of communication between the AUN3 device and the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device are out of scope of this specification. When initiating an EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure using such EAP method, the network shall select an ngKSI value.
The network shall send the selected ngKSI value to the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device along with each EAP message.
The network shall send the ABBA value as described in subclause0 to the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device along with the EAP-request message and EAP-success message.
The 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall not forward the ngKSI value or the ABBA value to the AUN3 NOTE1: The network provides the ngKSI value and the ABBA value since the ngKSI IE and the ABBA IE are mandatory IEs in AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
The 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device does not use the ngKSI value or the ABBA value provided by the network. If the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device is informed by AUN3 about failure to authenticate the network, the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall start timer T3520 when the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing the EAP-response message is sent.
Furthermore, the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.
T3510, T3517 or T3521). Upon receiving an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE containing an EAP-request message from the network, the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall stop timer T3520, if running, and then provides the EAP-request message to the AUN3 device as normally. If the network fails to authenticate the AUN3 device, the network handling depends upon the type of identity used by the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device in the initial NAS message, that is: a) if the 5G-GUTI was used; or b) if the SUCI was used. If the 5G-GUTI was used, the network should transport the EAP-failure message in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message as specified in the EAP result message transport procedure, initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device and restart the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received SUCI. If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device after an unsuccessful EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, the network should transport the EAP-failure message in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message as specified in the EAP result message transport procedure. If the EAP-failure message is received in an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall start timer minutes and 60 minutes, if the timer is not running (see subclause0).
Additionally, the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 a) if the counter for "USIM considered invalid for 5GS services over implementation-specific maximum value, proceed as specified in list item 1)-b) of subclause for the case that the 5GMM cause value received is #3; or b) otherwise, set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete the stored 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and ngKSI.
The USIM shall be considered invalid for 5GS services via non-3GPP access until switching off or the UICC containing the USIM is removed. If the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received by the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device, the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall abort any 5GMM signalling procedure, stop any of the timers T3510, 5GMM-DEREGISTERED and delete any stored SUCI. Upon receiving an EAP-success message from the network, the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall consider the procedure complete.
The a) the Master session key, if the AUN3 device does not support 5G key b) the K_(WAGF) key, if the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy; to the 5G-RG along with the EAP-success message as specified in subclauses and The 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall derive the Pairwise master key from the Master session key or the K_(WAGF) key as specified in subclause7B.
The 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device provides the EAP-success message to the AUN3 device. NOTE2: The network is aware from the AUN3 device subscription data in UDM whether the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy or not as specified in subclause7B.
7 of 3GPPTS301. Upon receiving an EAP-failure message from the network, the 5G-RG acting on behalf of the AUN3 device shall consider the procedure complete. EAP message reliable transport procedure.
The purpose of the EAP message reliable transport procedure is to the ABBA from the network to the UE and of an EAP-response message from the UE to the network. The EAP message reliable transport procedure is initiated by an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE. EAP message reliable transport procedure initiation by the network In order to initiate the EAP message reliable transport procedure, the AMF shall create an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the EAP-request message to be sent to the UE.
The AMF shall set the ngKSI IE of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the ngKSI value selected in subclause, subclause or subclause In this release of specification, the AMF shall set the ABBA IE of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the length of ABBA IE to 2 and the ABBA contents to be 2 octets in length with value 0000H as described in subclause The AMF shall send the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE, and the AMF shall start timer T3560 (see example in figure). Figure: EAP message reliable transport procedure Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message with the EAP message IE, the UE handles the EAP message received in the EAP message IE and the ABBA of the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. EAP message reliable transport procedure accepted by the UE The UE shall create an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message. If the received EAP message is an EAP-request message, the UE shall set the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the EAP-response message responding to the received EAP-request message. The UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the AMF. Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the AMF shall stop timer T356 If the EAP message IE is included in the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the AMF handles the EAP message received in the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message. Abnormal cases on the network side The following abnormal cases can be identified: a) Expiry of timer T356 The AMF shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3560, retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T356 This retransmission is repeated four times, i.
on the fifth expiry of timer T3560, the AMF shall abort the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and any ongoing 5GMM specific procedure, and release the N1 NAS signalling connection. b) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover. If the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message could not be delivered due to an intra AMF handover and the target TA is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra AMF handover the AMF shall procedure is reported by the lower layer and the N1 NAS signalling connection exists, the AMF shall retransmit the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST Abnormal cases in the UE The following abnormal cases can be identified: a) Authentication failure (5GMM cause #71 "ngKSI already in use"). The UE shall send an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with 5GMM cause #71 "ngKSI already in use", to the network and start the timer T3520 (see example in figure\).
Furthermore, the UE shall stop any of the retransmission timers that are running (e.
T3510, T3517 or T3521). Upon the first receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #71 "ngKSI already in use", the network performs message to the UE. NOTE 1: Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message from the UE with 5GMM cause #71 "ngKSI already in use", the network can also re-initiate the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement IE containing an EAP-request message from the network, the UE shall stop timer T3520, if running, process the EAP-request message as normal. If the network is validated successfully (an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST received), the UE shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and shall start any retransmission timers (e.
T3510, T3517 or T3521) if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first failed AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. b) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication from lower layers (if the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is triggered by The UE shall stop the timer T3520, if running, and re-initiate the c) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication with change in the current TAI (if the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is The UE shall stop the timer T3520, if running. If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure shall be aborted and a registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, it is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure. d) Transmission failure of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message or AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message indication without change in the current The UE shall stop the timer T3520, if running.
It is up to the UE implementation how to re-run the ongoing procedure that triggered the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement procedure. e) Network failing the authentication check. If the UE deems that the network has failed the authentication check, then it shall request RRC to locally release the RRC connection and treat the active cell as barred (see 3GPPTS304 or 3GPPTS304[25C]).
The UE shall start any retransmission timers (e.
T3510, T3517 or T3521), if they were running and stopped when the UE received the first AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message containing an ngKSI that was already in use. f) Change in the current TAI. If that the current TAI is not in the TAI list before the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message is sent, the UE may discard sending the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network and continue with the initiation of the registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update as For iteme, if no emergency service is started or is ongoing: The UE shall stop timer T3520, if the timer is running and the UE enters the N1 NAS signalling connection, or as the result of an inter-system change in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode from N1 mode to S1 mode. The UE shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check or assume that the authentication is not genuine and proceed as described in iteme above if any of the following occurs: the timer T3520 expires; the UE detects any combination of the EAP-based authentication failures: transmission of AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message with 5GMM cause #71 "ngKSI already in use", transmission of AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with an EAP-response message after detecting an error as described in subclause, with an EAP-response message after not accepting of the server certificate as described in subclause or with an EAP-response message after failing to authenticate the network as described in subclauseA.
1, during three consecutive authentication challenges.
The EAP-request/AKA'-challenge challenges shall be considered as consecutive only, if the EAP-request/AKA'-challenge challenges causing the second and third EAP-based authentication failure are received by the UE, while the timer T3520 started after the previous EAP-based authentication failure is running.
Not accepting of the server certificate shall be considered as consecutive only, if the EAP-request messages causing the second and third not accepting of the server certificate are received by the UE, while the timer T3520 started after the previous EAP request message causing the previous not accepting of the server certificate is NOTE 2: Reception of an EAP-failure message is not considered when determining the three consecutive authentication challenges or three consecutive not accepting of the server certificate. The UE shall stop timer T3520, if the timer is running and the UE enters the N1 NAS signalling connection, or as the result of an inter-system change in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode from N1 mode to S1 mode. emergency PDU session, and sends an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message to the AMF with the 5GMM cause appropriate for this cases (i.
#71) or an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message containing an EAP-response message as described in subclause, containing an EAP-response message after not accepting of the server certificate as described in subclause or containing an EAP-response message after failing to authenticate the network as described in subclauseA.
1, and receives the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message before the timeout of timer T3520, the UE shall deem that the network has passed the authentication check successfully, stop timer T3520, respectively, and execute the security mode control procedure. emergency PDU session when timer T3520 expires, the UE shall not deem that the network has failed the authentication check and not behave as described in item e.
Instead the UE shall continue using the current security context, if any, release all non-emergency PDU sessions, if any, by initiating UE-requested PDU session release procedure.
If there is an ongoing PDU session establishment procedure, the UE shall release all non-emergency PDU sessions upon completion of the PDU session The UE shall start any retransmission timers (e.
T3510, T3517 or they were running and stopped when the UE received the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message and detected an authentication failure; and the procedures associated with these timers have not yet been The UE shall consider itself to be registered for emergency services. EAP result message transport procedure.
The purpose of the EAP result message transport procedure is to provide an EAP-success message or an EAP-failure message, and ngKSI from the network to the UE, when the EAP message cannot be piggybacked by another The EAP result message transport procedure is initiated: by an AUTHENTICATION RESULT message with the EAP message IE carrying the EAP-success message or the EAP-failure message; or by an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message with the EAP message IE carrying EAP result message transport procedure initiation by the network In order to initiate the EAP result message transport procedure, the AMF shall create an AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or an AUTHENTICATION The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message to an EAP-success message or an EAP-failure message to be sent to the UE.
If the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message is provided to a 5G-RG that is acting on behalf of an AUN3 device and the EAP message IE is set to an EAP-success message, the AMF shall include the AUN3 device security key IE in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message with its value set a) the Master session key, if the AUN3 device does not support 5G key b) the K_(WAGF) key, if the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy. NOTE: The network is aware from the AUN3 device subscription data in UDM whether the AUN3 device supports 5G key hierarchy or not as specified in The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to an EAP-failure message to be sent to the UE.
The AMF shall set the ngKSI IE of the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the ngKSI value selected in subclause, subclause or subclause The AMF shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE (see example in Figure: EAP result message transport procedure Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message with the EAP message IE, the UE handles the EAP message received in the EAP message IE and the ABBA if received of the AUTHENTICATION RESULT message or in the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, and the 5G-RG that is acting on behalf of an AUN3 device handles the AUN3 device security key IE if received in the AUTHENTICATION RESULT 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure.
The purpose of the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is to provide mutual authentication between the UE and the network and to agree on the keys K_(AUSF), K_(SEAF) and K_(AMF) (see 3GPPTS301).
The cases when the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is used are defined in The network initiates the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE without the EAP message IE.
The network shall include the ngKSI and the ABBA in AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message. The 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure is always initiated and controlled by the network.
However, the UE can reject the 5G authentication challenge sent by the network. A partial native 5G NAS security context is established in the UE and the network when a 5G authentication is successfully performed.
During a successful 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, the CK and IK are computed by the USIM.
CK and IK are then used by the ME as key material to compute new keys K_(AUSF), K_(SEAF) and K_(AMF).
K_(AMF) is stored in the 5G NAS security contexts (see 3GPPTS301) of both the network and in the volatile memory of the ME while registered to the network, and is the root for the 5GS integrity protection and ciphering key hierarchy. NOTE1: Generation of the new K_(AUSF) and the new K_(SEAF) does not result into deletion of the valid K_(AUSF) and the valid K_(SEAF), if Upon successful completion of the 5G AKA based primary authentication, subclause) to take the new partial native 5G NAS security context (see subclause) after 5G AKA primary authentication is successful to avoid K_(AUSF) key mismatch between the UE and the network. Authentication initiation by the network The network may initiate a 5G AKA based primary authentication and key restrictions applicable after handover or inter-system change to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, see subclause The network initiates the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure by sending an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE and starting the timer T3560 (see example in figure).
The AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message shall contain the parameters necessary to calculate the authentication response (see 3GPPTS301).
This message shall include the ngKSI that will be used by the UE and AMF to identify the K_(AMF) and the partial native security context that is created if the authentication is successful.
This message shall also include the ABBA parameter.
In this release of specification, the network shall set the length of ABBA IE to 2 and the ABBA contents to be 2 octets in length with value 0000H as described in subclause If an ngKSI is contained in an initial NAS message during a 5GMM AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message when it initiates a 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure. Figure: 5G AKA based primary authentication and key Authentication response by the UE The UE shall respond to an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message.
With the exception of the cases described in subclause and respond with an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network. the PLMN identity to be used for the calculation of the new K_(AMF) from the 5G authentication challenge data according to the following rules: a) When the UE moves from 5GMM-IDLE mode to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, until the first handover, the UE shall use the PLMN identity of the selected b) After handover or inter-system change to N1 mode in 5GMM-CONNECTED PLMN identity received as part of the broadcast system information; 5G-GUTI, the UE shall use the PLMN identity that is part of the 5G-GUTI; that is part of the 4G-GUTI. calculated from the 5G authentication challenge data shall be stored in a new 5G NAS security context in the volatile memory of the ME. The USIM will compute the authentication response (RES) using the 5G authentication challenge data received from the ME, and pass RES to the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the UE shall store the received RAND together with the RES*, in the volatile memory of the ME.
When the UE value is equal to the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, then the ME shall not pass the RAND to the USIM, but shall send the AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message with the stored RES*.
If there is no valid stored RAND in the ME or the stored RAND is different from the new received value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the ME shall pass the RAND to the USIM, shall override any previously stored RAND and RES* with the new ones and start, or reset and restart timer T351 The RAND and RES* values stored in the ME shall be deleted and timer T3516, if running, shall be stopped: a) upon receipt of a 1) SECURITY MODE COMMAND message, 2) SERVICE REJECT message, 3) REGISTRATION REJECT message, 4) REGISTRATION ACCEPT message, 5) AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, or 6) SERVICE ACCEPT message; b) upon expiry of timer T3516; c) if the UE enters the 5GMM state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED or 5GMM-NULL; or d) if the UE enters 5GMM-IDLE mode. Authentication completion by the network Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the network stops the timer T3560 and checks the correctness of RES* (see If the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure has been completed successfully and the related ngKSI is stored in the 5G NAS security context of the network, the network shall include a different ngKSI value in the AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message when it Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, the network stops the timer T356 In the case where the 5GMM cause #21 "synch failure" is received, the core network may renegotiate with the UDM/AUSF and provide the UE with new authentication parameters. Authentication not accepted by the network If the authentication response (RES) returned by the UE is not valid, the network response depends upon the type of identity used by the UE in the initial NAS message, that is: if the 5G-GUTI was used; or if the SUCI was used. If the 5G-GUTI was used, the network should initiate an identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE and restart the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure with the received If the SUCI was used for identification in the initial NAS message or in a restarted 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, or the network decides not to initiate the identification procedure to retrieve SUCI from the UE after an unsuccessful 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure, the network should send an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message to the UE.
The network shall maintain, if any, the 5GMM-context and 5G NAS security context of Upon receipt of an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message, 1) if the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message has been successfully integrity checked by the NAS: the UE shall set the update status to 5U3 ROAMING NOT ALLOWED, delete the stored 5G-GUTI, TAI list, last visited registered TAI and ngKSI.

If an AUTHENTICATION REJECT message is received without integrity protection and if neither timer T3516 nor T3520 is running, then the UE shall discard the AUTHENTICATION REJECT message.
Additionally, the UE may request RRC to locally release the RRC connection and treat the active cell as barred (see 3GPPTS304 or 3GPPTS304[25C]). The UE shall stop timer T3520, if the timer is running and the UE enters the N1 NAS signalling connection, or as the result of an inter-system change in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode from N1 mode to S1 mode. The UE shall deem that the network has failed the authentication check or assume that the authentication is not genuine and proceed as described in itemg above if any of the following occurs: the timer T3520 expires; the UE detects any combination of the 5G authentication failures: 5GMM causes #20 "MAC failure", #21 "synch failure", #26 "non-5G authentication unacceptable" or #71 "ngKSI already in use", during three consecutive authentication challenges.
The 5G authentication challenges shall be considered as consecutive only, if the 5G authentication challenges causing the second and third 5G authentication failure are received by the UE, while the timer T3520 started after the previous 5G authentication failure is running. The UE shall stop timer T3520, if the timer is running and the UE enters the N1 NAS signalling connection, or as the result of an inter-system change in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode from N1 mode to S1 mode.

If the UE operating in single-registration mode has changed to S1 mode, it shall disable the N1 mode capability for 3GPP access. Depending on local requirements or operator preference for emergency services, if the UE has an emergency PDU session established or is establishing an emergency PDU session, the AMF need not follow the procedures specified for the authentication failure specified in the present subclause.
The AMF may respond to the AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message by initiating the security mode control procedure selecting the "null integrity protection algorithm" 5G-IA0, "null ciphering algorithm" 5G-EA0 or may abort the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and continue using the current security context, if any.
The AMF shall indicate to the SMF to perform the release of all non-emergency PDU sessions, if any.
If there is an ongoing PDU session establishment procedure, the AMF shall indicate to the SMF to perform the release of all non-emergency PDU sessions upon completion of the PDU session establishment procedure.

Security mode control procedure.
The purpose of the NAS security mode control procedure is to take a 5G NAS security context into use, and initialise and start NAS signalling security between the UE and the AMF with the corresponding 5G NAS keys and 5G NAS security algorithms. Furthermore, the network may also initiate the security mode control procedure in the following cases: NAS security context already in use; b) in order to change the value of uplink NAS COUNT used in the latest SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message as described in c) in order to provide the Selected EPS NAS security algorithms to the control procedure with other security related procedures in the AS or inside the core network see 3GPPTS301, subclause If the security mode control procedure is initiated after successful 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the security mode control procedure intends to bring into use the partial native 5G NAS security context created by the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure and the UE accepts received security mode command (see subclause), the ME shall: a) delete the valid K_(AUSF) and the valid K_(SEAF), if any; and b) consider the new K_(AUSF) to be the valid K_(AUSF), and the new K_(SEAF) to be the valid K_(SEAF), reset the SOR counter and the UE parameter update counter to zero, and store the valid K_(AUSF,) the valid K_(SEAF), the SOR counter and the UE parameter update counter as specified in annexC and use the valid K_(AUSF) in the verification of SOR transparent container and UE parameters update transparent container, if any are received. the 5G AKA based primary authentication procedure successfully authenticates a 5G ProSe layer-3 remote UE accessing the network via a 5G ProSe layer-3 UE-to-network relay UE served by the AMF. NAS security mode control initiation by the network The AMF initiates the NAS security mode control procedure by sending a SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the UE and starting timer T3560 (see The AMF shall reset the downlink NAS COUNT counter and use it to integrity protect the initial SECURITY MODE COMMAND message if the security mode control procedure is initiated: execution of the 5G AKA based primary authentication and key agreement procedure or the EAP based primary authentication and key agreement b) upon receipt of REGISTRATION REQUEST message, if the AMF needs to context flag is set to "mapped security context" in the ngKSI IE included in the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message). The AMF shall send the SECURITY MODE COMMAND message unciphered, but shall integrity protect the message with the 5G NAS integrity key based on K_(AMF) or mapped K'_(AMF) indicated by the ngKSI included in the message.
The AMF shall set the security header type of the message to "integrity protected with new 5G NAS security context".

The local actions to be taken by the AMF on receipt of a 5GMM STATUS message are implementation dependent. Network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure.
The purpose of the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is to enable the authentication, authorization and accounting server (AAA-S) via the Network Slice Specific and SNPN Authentication and Authorization Function (NSSAAF) to (re-)authenticate or (re-)authorize the upper layers of the UE. The network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure (see subclauses0 and in 3GPPTS201 and The network (re-)authenticates the UE using the EAP as specified in EAP has defined four types of EAP messages: a) an EAP-request message; b) an EAP-response message; c) an EAP-success message; and d) an EAP-failure message. The EAP-request message is transported from the network to the UE using the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message of the network slice-specific EAP message reliable transport procedure. The EAP-response message to the EAP-request message is transported from the UE to the network using the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message of the network slice-specific EAP message reliable If the (re-)authentication of the UE completes successfully or unsuccessfully, the EAP-success message or the EAP-failure message, respectively, is transported from the network to the UE using the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the network slice-specific result message transport procedure. There can be several rounds of exchange of an EAP-request message and a related EAP-response message for the AAA-S via the NSSAAF to complete the (re-)authentication and (re-)authorization of the request for an S-NSSAI (see example in figure). The AMF shall set the authenticator retransmission timer specified in subclause of IETFRFC3748 to infinite value. NOTE: The network slice-specific authentication and authorization retransmissions at the EAP layer of the AMF do not occur. Figure: Network slice-specific authentication and Network slice-specific EAP message reliable transport procedure Network slice-specific EAP message reliable transport procedure initiation In order to initiate the network slice-specific EAP message reliable The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message to the EAP-request message which is generated by the AMF or provided by the AAA-S via the NSSAAF. The AMF shall set the S-NSSAI IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message to the HPLMN S-NSSAI or the SNPN S-NSSAI to which the EAP-request message is related. The AMF shall send the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and start timer T3575 per S-NSSAI (see example in the UE shall stop timer T3346 if running.
The UE shall pass: a) the EAP-request message received in the EAP message IE; and b) the HPLMN S-NSSAI or the SNPN S-NSSAI in the S-NSSAI IE; to the upper layers.
Apart from this action, the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is transparent to the 5GMM layer of the UE. Network slice-specific EAP message reliable transport procedure accepted by the UE When the upper layers provide an EAP-response message associated with SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message. The UE shall set the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the EAP-response message. The UE shall set the S-NSSAI IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message to the HPLMN S-NSSAI or the SNPN S-NSSAI associated with the EAP-response message. The UE shall send the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message.
Apart from this action, the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is transparent to the 5GMM layer of the UE. message, the AMF shall stop timer T3575 and: a) pass the EAP-response message received in the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message associated with the HPLMN S-NSSAI or the SNPN S-NSSAI in the S-NSSAI IE to the upper b) provide the EAP-response message received in the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message associated with the HPLMN S-NSSAI or the SNPN S-NSSAI in the S-NSSAI IE to the AAA-S via the NSSAAF. Abnormal cases on the network side The following abnormal cases can be identified: The AMF shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3575, retransmit the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and shall reset and start timer T357 This retransmission is repeated four times, i.
e. on the fifth expiry of timer T3575, the AMF shall abort the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure for the S-NSSAI.
The AMF shall consider that the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure for the S-NSSAI is completed b) Lower layers indication of non-delivered NAS PDU due to handover If the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message could not be delivered due to an intra AMF handover and the target TAI is included in the TAI list, then upon successful completion of the intra AMF handover the AMF shall retransmit the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC reported by the lower layer and the N1 NAS signalling connection exists, the AMF shall retransmit the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION c) Network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure and ongoing network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure has been completed and the access type included in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is the same as the one for which the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is ongoing, the network shall abort the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure and shall progress the UE-initiated de-registration procedure.

Otherwise, the UE shall proceed with both procedures. d) Network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure and service request procedure collision If the SERVICE REQUEST message includes the UE request type IE with the Request type value set to "NAS signalling connection release" and the UE the ongoing service request procedure has been completed, the UE shall ignore the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and proceed with the service request procedure. If the the SERVICE REQUEST message does not include the UE request type IE with the Request type value set to "NAS signalling connection COMMAND message before the ongoing service request procedure has been completed, the UE shall proceed with both procedures. e) Network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure and registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update If the REGISTRATION REQUEST message includes the Unavailability AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message before the ongoing registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update has been completed, the UE shall ignore the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message and proceed with the registration procedure for mobility and periodic If the the REGISTRATION REQUEST message does not include the SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message before the ongoing registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update has been completed, the UE shall proceed with both procedures. Network slice-specific EAP result message transport procedure Network slice-specific EAP result message transport procedure initiation In order to initiate the network slice-specific EAP result message The AMF shall set the EAP message IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message to the EAP-success or EAP-failure message provided by the AAA-S via the NSSAAF. The AMF shall set the S-NSSAI IE of the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message to the HPLMN S-NSSAI or the SNPN S-NSSAI to which the EAP-success or EAP-failure message is related. The AMF shall send the NETWORK SLICE-SPECIFIC AUTHENTICATION RESULT message.
The AMF shall retain the authentication result for the UE and the HPLMN S-NSSAI or the SNPN S-NSSAI while the UE is registered to the PLMN (see subclause0 in 3GPPTS201). the UE shall pass: a) the EAP-success or EAP-failure message received in the EAP message b) the HPLMN S-NSSAI or the SNPN S-NSSAI in the S-NSSAI IE; to the upper layers.
Apart from this action, the network slice-specific authentication and authorization procedure is transparent to the 5GMM layer of the UE..
The registration procedure is always initiated by the UE and used for initial registration as specified in subclause or mobility and periodic registration update as specified in subclause When the UE needs to initiate registration over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in the same PLMN (e.
the 3GPP access and the selected N3IWF are located in the same PLMN), the UE: a) in 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED over 3GPP access shall not initiate registration over non-3GPP access; or b) in 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED over non-3GPP access shall not initiate registration over 3GPP access. NOTE1: To which access (i.
3GPP access or non-3GPP access) the UE initiates registration first is up to UE implementation. and the UE maintain: a) registration state and state machine over non-3GPP access; b) 5G NAS security context; d) registration area for non-3GPP access, which is associated with a e) non-3GPP de-registration timer in the UE and non-3GPP implicit de-registration timer in the AMF. A registration attempt counter is used to limit the number of subsequently rejected registration attempts.

The de-registration procedure with appropriate de-registration type shall be invoked by the network: a) if the network informs whether the UE should re-register to the The de-registration procedure with appropriate access type shall be invoked by the UE: a) to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access; b) to de-register for 5GS services over non-3GPP access when the UE is registered over non-3GPP access; c) to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses; d) to de-register for 5GS services over 3GPP access, if the UE is registered for disaster roaming over 3GPP access and has successfully registered over non-3GPP access on another PLMN; or e) to de-register for 5GS services if an event is triggered in the UE UE is not able to store its 5GMM and 5GSM context. NOTE1: If the UE is able to store its 5GMM and 5GSM contexts, the UE triggers the registration procedure for mobility and periodic The de-registration procedure with appropriate access type shall be invoked by the network: a) if the network needs to inform the UE that it is deregistered over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP access; b) if the network needs to inform the UE that it is deregistered over non-3GPP access when the UE is registered over non-3GPP access; or c) if the network needs to inform the UE that it is deregistered over 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses. If the de-registration procedure is triggered due to USIM removal, the UE shall indicate "switch off" in the de-registration type IE. that has an emergency PDU session, the AMF shall not send a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to the UE and indicate to the SMF to release all non-emergency PDU sessions as specified in release of the PDU sessions over the indicated access(es), if any, for is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions, the UE is considered as removed from the associated multicast MBS sessions. The UE is allowed to initiate the de-registration procedure even if the timer T3346 is running. NOTE2: When the UE has no PDU sessions over non-3GPP access, or the UE UE and the AMF need not initiate de-registration over the non-3GPP When the AMF enters the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED for 3GPP access, the AMF shall delete the stored UE radio capability information or the UE radio capability ID, if any. When upper layers indicate that emergency services are no longer required, the UE if still registered for emergency services, may perform If the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN, after completing the configuration of one or more entries of the "list of subscriber data", the UE should perform UE-initiated de-registration procedure.
To prevent the UE registered for onboarding services in SNPN allows for configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in PLMN via the user plane, from staying registered indefinitely, when an implementation if the AMF considers that the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE, the AMF shall locally de-registers the UE; or if the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED, the AMF shall initiate the network-initiated de-registration procedure (see subclause\). NOTE3: The value of the implementation specific timer for onboarding configuration of one or more entries of the "list of subscriber data" taking into consideration that configuration of SNPN subscription parameters in PLMN via the user plane or onboarding services in SNPN involves third party entities outside of the operator's network. NOTE4: How to determine the completion of the configuration of one or more entries of the "list of subscriber data" is UE implementation If the de-registration procedure is not due to switch off and upper layers request establishing an emergency PDU session before the de-registration procedure has been completed, the UE shall abort the de-registration procedure, perform local de-registration and initiate a If the UE in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode determines to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN due to SOR, then based on the conditions as perform UE-initiated de-registration procedure. If the UE is registered for disaster roaming services, and the UE receives an indication of whether disaster roaming is enabled in the UE update transparent container, the UE shall perform UE-initiated UE-initiated de-registration procedure initiation The de-registration procedure is initiated by the UE by sending a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message (see example in figure).
The De-registration type IE included in the message indicates whether the de-registration procedure is due to a "switch off" or not.
The access type included in the message indicates whether the de-registration a) for 5GS services over 3GPP access when the UE is registered over 3GPP b) for 5GS services over non-3GPP access when the UE is registered over c) for 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses. 5G-GUTI, the UE shall populate the 5GS mobile identity IE with its SUCI SUCI, start timer T3519 and store the value of the SUCI sent in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message; and SUCI, then the UE shall populate the5GS mobile identity IE with its PEI. If the de-registration request is not due to switch off and the UE is in the state 5GMM-REGISTERED or 5GMM-REGISTERED-INITIATED, timer T3521 shall be started in the UE after the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has been sent.
The UE shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED-INITIATED. seconds to send the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
During this period, the UE may be switched off as soon as the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message If the network indicated support for the unavailability period in the last registration procedure; and an event is triggered in the UE that a) the use of unavailability period is not due to NR satellite access discontinuous coverage and the UE is unable to store its 5GMM and 5GSM b) the use of unavailability period is due to NR satellite access the UE shall include the Unavailability information IE, and set the De-registration type to "Normal de-registration" in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
The UE shall start the timer T3521 and enter the state If the UE is sending the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message from 5GMM-IDLE mode and the UE needs to send non-cleartext IEs, the UE shall send the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message including the NAS message container IE as The 5G-RG shall not initiate the de-registration procedure for itself until it successfully de-registers all the AUN3 devices connected to it, if any, by initiating the de-registration procedure on behalf of the Figure: UE-initiated de-registration procedure UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion When the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message is received by the AMF, the AMF De-registration type IE does not indicate "switch off".
Otherwise, the procedure is completed when the AMF receives the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST The UE, when receiving the DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message, shall stop timer T3521, stop timer T3519 if running, and delete any stored SUCI. UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS services over 3GPP access If the access type in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates that the de-registration procedure is for 3GPP access, the AMF shall trigger release of the PDU session(s) established over 3GPP access, if any.
If a PDU session is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions, the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions and the SMF shall consider the UE as removed from the associated multicast MBS sessions.

If there is an MA PDU session with user plane resources established on 3GPP access only, the AMF shall PDU session is associated with one or more MBS multicast sessions, the UE shall locally leave the associated MBS multicast sessions.
The UE is marked as inactive in the AMF for 5GS services for 3GPP access.
The AMF shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED for 3GPP access. If the UE supports N1 mode only and the de-registration request is not due to switch off, then: a) if the de-registration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS services, then the UE shall enter the 5GMM-NULL state for 3GPP b) otherwise, the UE shall enter the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state for 3GPP NOTE: Case b) is applicable when the UE is also registered over non-3GPP If the access type indicates that the de-registration procedure is for 3GPP access or for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, and the UE is operating in single-registration mode, it shall additionally proceed as specified in 3GPPTS201, subclause, for the case when the UE receives an EMM message DETACH ACCEPT.
Furthermore, if the UE supports A/Gb or Iu mode, it shall disable the N1 mode capability for UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS services over non-3GPP access If the access type in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST indicates that the de-registration procedure is for non-3GPP access, the AMF shall trigger release of the PDU session(s) established over non-3GPP access, if any. If there is an MA PDU session with user plane resources established on both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access in the same PLMN or in different PLMNs, the AMF shall trigger SMF to perform release of user plane resources on non-3GPP access, and the UE shall consider the user plane resources on non-3GPP access as released.
If there is an MA PDU session established on non-3GPP access, the AMF shall trigger SMF to perform release of user plane resources on non-3GPP access, and the UE shall consider the user plane resources on non-3GPP access as released.
If the UE has an MA PDU session with user plane resources established on of the MA PDU session.
The UE is marked as inactive in the AMF for 5GS services for non-3GPP access.
The AMF shall enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED over non-3GPP access. If the de-registration request is not due to switch off, the UE shall: a) if the de-registration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS services, enter the 5GMM-NULL state for non-3GPP access; b) otherwise, enter the 5GMM-DEREGISTERED state for non-3GPP access. NOTE: Case b) is applicable when the UE is also registered over 3GPP UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS services over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access If the access type in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST indicates that the de-registration procedure is for both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access when the UE is registered in the same PLMN over both accesses, the descriptions for UE-initiated de-registration procedure completion for 5GS services over 3GPP access and over non-3GPP access, as specified in subclauses and , shall be followed. Abnormal cases in the UE The following abnormal cases can be identified: a) Lower layer failure or release of the N1 NAS signalling connection before reception of DEREGISTRATION ACCEPT message. The de-registration procedure shall be aborted and the UE proceeds as 1) if the de-registration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS services, the UE shall enter the 5GMM-NULL state; or 2) if the de-registration type "normal de-registration" was requested for reasons other than disabling of 5GS services, the UE shall enter the b) The lower layers indicate that the access attempt is barred. The UE shall not start the de-registration signalling procedure.
The UE stays in the current serving cell and applies the normal cell reselection process.
Receipt of the access barred indication shall not The de-registration signalling procedure is started, if still needed, when the lower layers indicate that the barring is alleviated for the access category with which the access attempt was associated. ba) The lower layers indicate that: 1) access barring is applicable for all access categories except categories 0 and 2 and the access category with which the access attempt was associated is other than 0 and 2; or 2) access barring is applicable for all access categories except category 0 and the access category with which the access attempt was associated is other than If the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has not been sent, the UE shall proceed as specified for case b.
If the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message has been sent, the UE shall proceed as specified for case a. If the de-registration procedure was performed based on conditions specified in 3GPPTS222 annexC, on the expiry of timer T3521 the de-registration procedure shall be aborted and the UE shall locally release the established N1 NAS signalling connection and enter the Otherwise, on the first four expiries of the timer, the UE shall retransmit the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message and shall reset and restart timer T352 On the fifth expiry of timer T3521, the de-registration procedure shall be aborted and the UE proceeds as 1) if the de-registration procedure was performed due to disabling of 5GS services, the UE shall enter the 5GMM-NULL state; or 2) if the de-registration type "normal de-registration" was requested for reasons other than disabling of 5GS services, the UE shall enter the d) De-registration procedure collision. De-registration containing de-registration type "switch off": UE-initiated de-registration procedure has been completed, this message shall be ignored and the UE-initiated de-registration procedure shall.
UE-initiated de-registration procedure has been completed, it shall treat the message as specified in subclause with the following If the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message received by the UE contains de-registration type "re-registration required", and the UE-initiated de-registration procedure is with de-registration type "normal If the access type included in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message sent by the UE is same as access type sent by the network, the UE need not initiate the registration procedure for initial registration; or If the access type included in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message sent by the UE is not same as access type sent by the network, the UE shall initiate the registration procedure for initial registration for the access type not indicated in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message sent by the UE but indicated by the network. e) De-registration and 5GMM common procedure collision. De-registration containing de-registration type "switch off": the de-registration procedure has been completed, this message shall be ignored and the de-registration procedure shall continue..
the de-registration procedure has been completed, both the 5GMM common procedure and the de-registration procedure shall continue; or container type "Service-level-AA container" before the de-registration procedure has been completed, this message shall be ignored and the de-registration procedure shall continue. f) Change in the current TAI. If that the current TAI is not in the stored TAI list before the UE-initiated de-registration procedure is completed, the UE proceeds as 1) if the de-registration procedure was initiated for reasons other than removal of the USIM, the UE is to be switched off or due to the last Tsor-cm timer expiry or stopped (see 3GPPTS222), the de-registration procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated after periodic update used for mobility (i.
the 5GS registration type IE set to "mobility registration updating" in the REGISTRATION REQUEST 2) if the de-registration procedure was initiated due to removal of the USIM or the UE is to be switched off or due to the last Tsor-cm timer expiry or stopped (see 3GPPTS222), the UE shall abort the g) Transmission failure of DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message indication with change in the current TAI. If the current TAI is not in the TAI list, the UE proceeds as follows: 1) if the de-registration procedure was initiated for reasons other than removal of the USIM , the UE is to be switched off or due to the last Tsor-cm timer expiry or stopped (see 3GPPTS222), the de-registration procedure shall be aborted and re-initiated after 2) if the de-registration procedure was initiated due to removal of the USIM or the UE is to be switched off or due to the last Tsor-cm timer expiry or stopped (see 3GPPTS222), the UE shall abort the If the current TAI is still part of the TAI list, the UE shall restart h) Transmission failure of DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message indication without change in the current TAI. The UE shall restart the de-registration procedure. i) The lower layers indicate that the RRC connection has been suspended. De-registration containing de-registration type "switch off":.
The UE shall wait for an implementation-dependent time and shall restart the de-registration procedure, if still needed, upon expiry of Timer T3521 shall be stopped if still running. Abnormal cases in the network side The following abnormal cases can be identified: a non-globally-unique SNPN identity for which the UE has no valid valid subscription, and the de-registration procedure is not due to "switch off", the network shall initiate the de-registration procedure. cause #74 "Temporarily not authorized for this SNPN". a globally-unique SNPN identity for which the UE has no valid valid subscription, and the de-registration procedure is not due to "switch off", the network shall initiate the de-registration procedure. cause #75 "Permanently not authorized for this SNPN". broadcasted by the CAG cell is authorized based on the UE's "allowed CAG list" for the current PLMN of the CAG ID broadcasted by the CAG cell is authorized based on the UE's "allowed CAG list" for the current PLMN and the de-registration procedure is not due to "switch off", the AMF shall initiate the message including the 5GMM cause #76 "Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only" if the UE supports CAG.
Otherwise, the network shall operate as described in bulletg) of subclause "CAG information list" includes an entry associated with the current PLMN, where the entry contains an "indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells" UE whose "CAG information list" includes an entry associated with the current PLMN, where the entry contains an "indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells" and the de-registration procedure is not due to "switch off", the AMF shall initiate the message including the 5GMM cause #76 "Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only" if the UE supports CAG.
Otherwise, the network shall operate as described in bulletg) of subclause e) De-registration and registration procedure for initial registration "initial registration" or "emergency registration" in the 5GS registration type IE from the UE before the UE-initiated de-registration procedure, which is not due to switch off, has been completed, the network shall abort the de-registration procedure and the registration procedure shall be progressed. Network-initiated de-registration procedure initiation The network initiates the de-registration procedure by sending a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to the UE (see example in UE with a 5GMM messages (e.
SERVICE REJECT message or REGISTRATION REJECT message) with 5GMM cause #10 "implicitly de-registered" only when the UE initiates a 5GMM procedure. The network may include a 5GMM cause IE to specify the reason for the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
The network shall start timer T352 The network shall indicate whether re-registration is needed or not in the De-registration type IE.
The network shall also indicate via the access type whether the de-registration procedure is: a) for 3GPP access only; b) for non-3GPP access only; or c) for 3GPP access, non-3GPP access or both when the UE is registered in the same PLMN for both accesses. If the network de-registration is triggered due to network slice-specific authentication and authorization failure or revocation as specified in subclause, then the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #62 "No network slices available" in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
In addition, if the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI, the AMF shall include the Extended rejected NSSAI IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message; otherwise, the AMF shall include the Rejected NSSAI IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. In roaming scenarios, if the Extended rejected NSSAI IE is included in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message, the AMF shall provide mapped S-NSSAI(s) for the rejected NSSAI. If the UE supports extended rejected NSSAI and the network de-registration is triggered due to mobility management based network slice admission control as specified in subclause, then the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #62 "No network slices available" in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message.
In addition, the rejection cause "S-NSSAI not available due to maximum number of UEs reached" in the Extended rejected NSSAI IE of the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST to CAG restrictions, the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #76 "Not authorized for this CAG or authorized for CAG cells only" and should include the "CAG information list" in the CAG information list IE or the Extended CAG information list IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST NOTE2: If the UE supports extended CAG information list, the CAG information list can be included either in the CAG information list IE or Extended CAG information list IE. NOTE3: It is unexpected for network to send REGISTRATION REJECT message to the UE with 5GMM cause value #76 in non-CAG cell and not indicate "Indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells" for the serving PLMN in the Extended CAG information list or the CAG due to CAG restrictions, the network shall operate as described in If the network de-registration is triggered because the network to operate, see 3GPPTS202, the network shall set the 5GMM cause value in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to #78 "PLMN not allowed to operate at the present UE location". If the network de-registration is triggered due to: a) an unsuccessful outcome of an ongoing UUAA-MM procedure; supporting UAS service requesting UAS services; or aerial UE subscription information, then the network shall set the 5GMM cause value in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message to #79 "UAS services not allowed". NOTE4: If the UE supporting UAS service has requested other services than UAS services, or if there are other ongoing network slice-specific authentication and authorization on pending NSSAIs, it is then an operator policy or configuration decision whether to keep the UE supporting UAS service registered to the network, but that UE supporting UAS services is not allowed to access UAS services via 5GS as specified location of the UE, the network shall set the 5GMM cause value to #11 Disaster return wait range IE in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the network de-registration is triggered because the AMF determines that, by UE subscription and operator's preferences, all of the TAIs received from the satellite NG-RAN are forbidden for roaming or for regional provision of service, the AMF shall include the TAI(s) in: a) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming" IE; or b) the Forbidden TAI(s) for the list of "5GS forbidden tracking areas for regional provision of service" IE; or in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. If the network de-registration is triggered because the AMF determines that the UE operating as an IAB-node by subscription is not authorized for IAB-node operation, the AMF shall set the 5GMM cause value to #36 "IAB-node operation not authorized" in the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST due to the UE no longer being allowed to operate as MBSR based on the UE subscription and the local policy and the UE is allowed to operate as a UE, then the network shall indicate "re-registration required" in the De-registration type IE of the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message based on If the network de-registration is triggered due to the UE that was not allowed for MBSR operation becoming allowed to operate as MBSR based on the UE subscription and the local policy, then the network shall indicate "re-registration required" in the De-registration type IE of the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message. The AMF shall trigger the SMF to release locally the PDU session(s) over the indicated access(es), if any, for the UE and enter state more multicast MBS sessions, the SMF shall consider the UE as removed from the associated multicast MBS sessions. Figure: Network-initiated de-registration procedure Network-initiated de-registration procedure completion by the UE Upon receiving the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message, if the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates "re-registration required" and the is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions, the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions.

If the UE is operating in single-registration mode, the UE shall also stop the ESM back-off timer(s) not related to congestion control (see subclause in ACCEPT message to the network and enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED for 3GPP access.
Furthermore, the UE shall, after the completion of the de-registration procedure, and the release of the existing NAS signalling connection, if any Tsor-cm timer(s) were running and have PLMN (see 3GPPTS222) on 3GPP access, otherwise initiate an initial registration.
The UE should also re-establish any previously established PDU sessions over 3GPP access.
For any previously established MA PDU sessions with user plane resources established on both accesses the UE should also re-establish the user plane resources over 3GPP access, and for any previously established MA PDU sessions with user plane resources established only on the 3GPP access the UE should re-establish the MA PDU session over 3GPP access.

The UE enter the state 5GMM-DEREGISTERED for both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
Furthermore, the UE shall, after the completion of the de-registration procedure, and the release of the existing NAS signalling connection, if any Tsor-cm timer(s) were running and have PLMN (see 3GPPTS222) on 3GPP access, otherwise initiate an initial registration over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
The UE should also re-establish any previously established PDU sessions over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
For any previously established MA PDU sessions the UE should also re-establish the MA PDU session and the user plane resources which were established previously. NOTE1: When the de-registration type indicates "re-registration required", user interaction is necessary in some cases when the UE cannot re-establish the PDU session (s), if any, automatically. Upon receiving the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message, if the DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message indicates "re-registration not required" and the is associated with one or more multicast MBS sessions, the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions.

eCALL-INACTIVE state. Authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay and 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay.
The purpose of the authentication and key agreement procedure: a) for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay, is to perform the authentication for 5G ProSe remote UE initiated by the 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay UE and to agree on the K_(AUSF_P) and K_(NR_ProSe) when the security for 5G ProSe communication via 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay is performed over control plane as specified in 3GPPTS303; or b) for 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay, is to perform the authentication for 5G ProSe end UE initiated by the 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay UE and to agree on the K_(AUSF_P) and K_(NR_ProSe) when the security for 5G ProSe communication via 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay is performed over control plane as specified in 3GPPTS303. The procedure as shown in figure is initiated by the UE when the UE receives the ProSe direct link establishment request including the SUCI or the CP-PRUK ID of: a) the 5G ProSe remote UE from the 5G ProSe remote UE; or b) the 5G ProSe end UE from the 5G ProSe end UE, for establishing secure PC5 unicast link as specified in If the network decides to process the relay key request message, the EAP based authentication and key agreement procedure is initiated and controlled by the network.
The exchanges of EAP messages between: a) the 5G ProSe remote UE and the network; or b) the 5G ProSe end UE and the network, are relayed by the UE. Figure: Authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay and 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay ProSe relay transaction identity (PRTI) link as specified in 3GPPTS254[19E], the UE shall allocate an available PRTI value for the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay and associate this PRTI value with the 5G ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe The UE shall release the PRTI value allocated to the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay when the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay completes or is UE-initiated authentication and key agreement procedure initiation ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe end UE including the SUCI or the CP-PRUK ID of the 5G ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe end UE, for establishing a secure PC5 unicast link as specified in 3GPPTS254[19E] when the security for 5G ProSe communication via 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay is performed over control plane as specified in 3GPPTS303, the UE shall: c) set the PRTI IE of the RELAY KEY REQUEST message to the allocated d) set the relay key request parameters IE of the RELAY KEY REQUEST message with SUCI or the CP-PRUK ID, relay service code, and nonce_1 received from the of the 5G ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe end UE; e) send the RELAY KEY REQUEST message; and f) start the timer T3527 upon sending the RELAY KEY REQUEST message. UE-initiated authentication and key agreement procedure accepted by the network Upon receiving the RELAY KEY REQUEST message, the AMF processes the message and interacts with the AUSF of the 5G ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe end UE as specified in 3GPPTS303.
If EAP-AKA' authentication for the 5G ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe end UE is initiated by the network, the AMF shall: b) set the PRTI IE of the RELAY AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the PRTI value of the received RELAY KEY REQUEST message; c) set the EAP message IE of the RELAY AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to EAP request message received from the AUSF; and d) send the RELAY AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message to the UE. Upon receiving the RELAY AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message, the UE stops the timer T3527 and forwards the EAP message to the 5G ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe end UE as specified in 3GPPTS254[19E]. Upon receiving the EAP response message from the 5G ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe end UE as specified in 3GPPTS254[19E], the UE shall: b) set the PRTI IE of the RELAY AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the PRTI value of the received RELAY AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message; c) set the EAP message IE of the RELAY AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to EAP response message received from the 5G ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe end UE; and message to the AMF. After receiving the RELAY AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message, the AMF may message according to further handling of EAP-AKA' authentication from the AUSF as specified in 3GPPTS303.
The UE repeats the handling of the RELAY AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message as described above. Upon receiving the message from the AUSF that the authentication is successful, the AMF shall: b) set the PRTI IE of the RELAY KEY ACCEPT message to the PRTI value of the RELAY KEY REQUEST message; c) include the EAP message IE of the RELAY KEY ACCEPT message set to EAP-success message received from the AUSF, if any; d) include the relay key response parameters IE of the RELAY KEY ACCEPT message set to K_(NR_ProSe) and nonce_2 received from AUSF; and e) include the CP-PRUK ID in the relay key response parameters IE of the RELAY KEY ACCEPT message. Upon receiving the RELAY KEY ACCEPT message, the UE shall forward the EAP-success message, if any, and nonce_2 to the 5G ProSe remote UE or the 5G ProSe end UE as specified in 3GPPTS254[19E], and consider the authentication as completed successfully.
The UE shall store the CP-PRUK ID to be used in the remote UE report procedure as specified in UE-initiated authentication and key agreement procedure not accepted by the network If the UE-initiated authentication and key agreement procedure is not accepted by the network, the AMF shall: b) set the PRTI IE of the RELAY KEY REJECT message to the PRTI value of the received RELAY KEY REQUEST message if the network decides to reject the RELAY KEY REQUEST message; or NOTE: The network decides to reject the RELAY KEY REQUEST message when e.
the CP-PRUK is not found in the network. set the PRTI IE of the RELAY KEY REJECT message to the PRTI value of the received RELAY AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message and include the EAP message IE set with EAP-failure message if the AMF receives an EAP-failure message from the AUSF; and c) send the RELAY KEY REJECT message to the UE. Upon receiving the RELAY KEY REJECT message, the UE shall consider the authentication has failed and perform the PC5 signalling protocol procedure as specified in subclause of 3GPP254[19E]. Abnormal cases in the UE The following abnormal cases in the UE can be identified: a) Transmission failure of RELAY KEY REQUEST message or RELAY KEY AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message indication from lower layers. The UE shall abort the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay and perform the PC5 signalling protocol procedure as specified in subclause of 3GPP254[19E]. b) Expiry of timer T352 The UE shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3527, retransmit the RELAY KEY REQUEST message or the RELAY KEY AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message and shall reset and start timer T352 This retransmission is repeated four times, i.
on the fifth expiry of timer T3527, the procedure shall be aborted. c) Collision between the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay and The UE shall abort the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay, proceed with the network initiated de-registration procedure, and perform the PC5 signalling protocol procedure as specified in subclause of Abnormal cases on the network side The following abnormal cases on the network side can be identified: a) Lower layer failure before the RELAY KEY AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE The network shall abort the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay. b) Collision between the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay and The network shall abort the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay and proceed with the UE-initiated de-registration procedure. c) Collision between the authentication and key agreement procedure for 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay or 5G ProSe UE-to-UE relay and other 5GMM procedures other than in itemb. The network shall progress both procedures. 5GMM connection management procedures.
The purpose of the service request procedure is to change the 5GMM mode from 5GMM-IDLE to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.
If the UE is not using 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS optimization, this procedure is used to request the establishment of user-plane resources for PDU sessions which are established without user-plane resources.
In latter case, the 5GMM mode can be the 5GMM-IDLE mode or the 5GMM-CONNECTED mode if the UE requires to establish user-plane resources for PDU sessions. If the UE is using 5GS services with control plane CIoT 5GS optimization, this procedure can be used for UE initiated transfer of user data via the control plane from 5GMM-IDLE mode. NOTE1: The lower layer indicates when the user-plane resources for PDU sessions are successfully established or released. This procedure is used when: the network has downlink signalling pending over 3GPP access and the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access; the network has downlink signalling pending over non-3GPP access, the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access and in 5GMM-IDLE or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access; the UE has uplink signalling pending over 3GPP access and the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access; the network has downlink user data pending over 3GPP access and the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access; the network has downlink user data pending over non-3GPP access, the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access and in 5GMM-IDLE or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access; the UE has user data pending over 3GPP access and the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access; the UE has user data pending over non-3GPP access and the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access; the UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode over non-3GPP access, receives an indication from the lower layers of non-3GPP access, that the access stratum connection is established between the UE and the network, if T3346 is the UE in 5GMM-IDLE or 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access receives a request from the upper layers to perform emergency services fallback and performs emergency services fallback as specified in subclause the UE has to request resources for V2X communication over PC5; the UE has to request resources for 5G ProSe direct discovery over PC5 or 5G ProSe direct communication over PC5; the UE has to request resources for A2X communication over PC5; NOTE2: The purpose for the UE to request resources for V2X communication over PC5, 5G ProSe direct discovery over PC5 and 5G ProSe direct communication over PC5 can be to perform the ranging and sidelink positioning service over PC the MUSIM UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode requests the network to remove the the MUSIM UE requests the release of the NAS signalling connection or rejects the paging request from the network; or the UE supporting the reconnection to the network due to RAN timing RAN timing synchronization status. This procedure shall not be used for: a) initiating user data transfer or CIoT user data via the control b) PDU session management related signalling other than for performing LADN or for performing the UE-requested PDU session modification when the UE is located outside the LADN service area.

The AMF shall send the SERVICE ACCEPT message and indicate that this PDU session ID is inactive using the PDU.
The paging procedure is performed only in 3GPP access and used by the the UE.
The paging procedure is also used by the network to request the UE to re-establish the user-plane resources of PDU sessions for downlink user data transport.
Another purpose of the paging procedure is to request the UE to re-establish the user-plane resources of PDU session(s) associated with non-3GPP access over 3GPP access. Additionally, the network can use the paging procedure to initiate the For the UE using eDRX, the network initiates the paging procedure when NAS signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE within the paging time window and requests the lower layers to include the eDRX cycle length and paging time window length in the paging message.
If NAS signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE outside the paging time window and the eDRX value that the network provides to the UE in the Negotiated extended DRX parameters IE during the last registration procedure indicates: a) the eDRX cycle length duration of the E-UTRA cell connected to 5GCN, is higher than 2 seconds; or b) the eDRX cycle length duration of the NR cell connected to 5GCN, is higher than 14 seconds, beginning of the next paging time window. operator can take possible imperfections in the synchronization between If the network detects that the pending user data to be sent to the UE is related to the voice service as specified in 3GPPTS202 and the network decides to initiate the paging procedure based on the stored paging restriction information, if any, the AMF should request the lower layer to include the Voice Service Indication in the paging message when the UE and the network support the paging indication for voice services. Paging for 5GS services.
The network shall initiate the paging procedure for 5GS services when NAS signalling messages or user data is pending to be sent to the UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode over 3GPP access (see example in figure) and there is no paging restriction applied in the network for that paging. To initiate the procedure the 5GMM entity in the AMF requests the lower layer to start paging and shall start timer T351 If downlink signalling or user data is pending to be sent over non-3GPP access, the 5GMM entity in the AMF shall indicate to the lower layer that the paging is associated to non-3GPP access. The network shall not page the UE to re-establish user-plane resources of PDU session(s) associated with non-3GPP access over 3GPP access if all the PDU sessions of the UE that are established over the 3GPP access are associated with control plane only indication or S-NSSAI(s) associated with PDU session(s) are not in the UE’s allowed NSSAI for a PLMN on 3GPP access. stored paging restriction of the UE and the Paging restriction type in the stored paging restriction is set to: a) "All paging is restricted", the network should not page the UE; b) "All paging is restricted except for voice service", the network should page the UE only when: 1) the pending downlink user data for the UE is considered as voice service related by the network; c) "All paging is restricted except for specified PDU session(s)", the network should page the UE only when: 1) for PDU session(s) that paging is not restricted based on the stored paging restriction, the network has downlink user data pending; or d) "All paging is restricted except for voice service and specified PDU session(s)", the network should page the UE only when: 1) the pending downlink user data for the UE is considered as voice service related by the network; or 2) for PDU session(s) that paging is not restricted based on the stored paging restriction, the network has downlink user data pending. stored paging restriction of the UE and the Paging restriction type in the stored paging restriction is set to: a) "All paging is restricted", the network should not page the UE; b) "All paging is restricted except for voice service", the network should page the UE only when: 1) the pending downlink signalling for the UE is 5GMM signalling or 5GSM signalling of the PDU session of voice service; c) "All paging is restricted except for specified PDU session(s)", the network should page the UE only when: 1) the pending downlink signalling for the UE is 5GMM signalling; or 2) for PDU session(s) that paging is not restricted based on the stored paging restriction, the network has downlink 5GSM signalling pending; or d) "All paging is restricted except for voice service and specified PDU session(s)", the network should page the UE only when: 1) the pending downlink signalling for the UE is 5GMM signalling or 5GSM signalling of the PDU session of voice service; or 2) for PDU session(s) that paging is not restricted based on the stored paging restriction, the network has downlink 5GSM signalling pending. NOTE1: If the network pages the UE due to downlink signalling pending, the network initiates the release of the N1 NAS signalling connection after network-requested procedure is completed. The 5GMM entity in the AMF may provide the lower layer with the "allowed CAG list" and an "indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells" for the current PLMN, if available, and with the "allowed CAG list" and an "indication that the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG cells" per equivalent PLMN, if available.

This clause describes the procedures used for 5GS session management (5GSM) performed over an N1 NAS signalling connection. The main function of the 5GSM sublayer is to support the PDU session handling in the UE and in the SMF (transferred via the AMF). The 5GSM comprises procedures for: the authentication and authorization, establishment, modification and release of PDU sessions; and request for performing handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, or to transfer an existing PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS. an SMF.
PDU sessions can remain established even if the radio and network resources constituting the corresponding PDU session between the UE and the SMF are temporarily released. 5GSM procedures can be performed only if a 5GMM context has been established between the UE and the AMF, and the secure exchange of NAS messages has been initiated by the AMF by use of the 5GMM procedures a PDU session can be established.
If no 5GMM context has been established, the 5GMM sublayer has to initiate the establishment of a 5GMM context by use of the 5GMM procedures as described in clause The UE can request the network to modify or release PDU sessions.
The Types of 5GSM procedures Three types of 5GSM procedures can be distinguished: a) Procedures related to PDU sessions: These procedures are initiated by the network and are used for authentication and authorization or manipulation of PDU sessions: 1) PDU authentication and authorization; 2) network-requested PDU session modification; 3) network-requested PDU session release; and 4) service-level authentication and authorization. This procedure is initiated by the UE and to request for establishment of PDU sessions or to perform handover of an existing PDU session between 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, or to transfer an existing PDN connection in the EPS to the 5GS: UE-requested PDU session establishment. b) Transaction related procedures: These procedures are initiated by the UE to request for handling of PDU 1) UE-requested PDU session modification; and 2) UE-requested PDU session release. This procedure is initiated by the 5G ProSe UE-to-network relay UE and is used for the manipulation of PDU sessions: A successful transaction related procedure initiated by the UE triggers the network to execute one of the following procedures related to PDU session; network-requested PDU session modification procedure or network-requested PDU session release procedure.
The UE treats the start of the procedure related to the PDU session as completion of the.
UE and the network side are described. 5GSM sublayer states in the UE.
In the following subclauses, the possible 5GSM sublayer states of the UE are described and shown in figure NOTE1: Not all possible transitions are shown in this figure.

For this purpose, the UE shall memorize the DNN provided to the network during the PDU session establishment.
The timer T3396 associated with no DNN will never be started due to any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session.
If the timer T3396 associated with no DNN is running, it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an allowed to initiate the: a) PDU session establishment procedure; b) PDU session modification procedure; or c) NAS transport procedure for sending CIoT user data; PS data off UE status. In an SNPN, if T3396 is running or is deactivated for the registered holder, with the selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription, then the UE is not allowed to initiate the a) PDU session establishment procedure; or b) PDU session modification procedure; data off UE status. In an SNPN, if the UE supports equivalent SNPNs, the timer T3396 is running or is deactivated for all the equivalent SNPNs, is associated selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription, then the UE is not allowed to initiate the: a) PDU session establishment procedure; or b) PDU session modification procedure; PS data off UE status. Handling of S-NSSAI based congestion control The network may detect and start performing S-NSSAI based congestion control when one or more S-NSSAI congestion criteria as specified in non-emergency PDU session, then the network uses the selected DNN.
If the network uses the selected S-NSSAI. In case of PLMN or SNPN, in the UE, 5GS session management timers T3584 for the S-NSSAI based congestion control are started and stopped on a per S-NSSAI, DNN and PLMN or SNPN basis.
If the 5GSM congestion re-attempt indicator IE with the ABO bit set to "The back-off timer is applied in all PLMNs or equivalent SNPNs " is included in the 5GSM message with the 5GSM cause value #67 "insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN", then the UE applies the timer T3584 for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs.
Otherwise, the UE applies the timer T3584 for the registered PLMN or the registered SNPN.
If the timer T3584 applies for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs, the timer T3584 the S-NSSAI is provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment, the timer T3584 is associated with the [mapped S-NSSAI, DNN] combination of the PDU session. In case of PLMN or SNPN, in the UE, 5GS session management timers T3585 for the S-NSSAI based congestion control are started and stopped on a per S-NSSAI and PLMN or SNPN basis.
If the 5GSM congestion re-attempt indicator IE with the ABO bit set to "The back-off timer is applied in all PLMNs or all equivalent SNPNs " is included in the 5GSM message with the 5GSM cause value #69 "insufficient resources for specific slice", then the UE applies the timer T3585 for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs.
Otherwise, the UE applies the timer T3585 for the registered PLMN or registered SNPN.
If the timer T3585 applies for all the PLMNs or all the equivalent SNPNs, the timer T3585 starts when the provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment, the timer T3585 is associated with the mapped S-NSSAI of the PDU session.
Additionally, if the 5GSM congestion re-attempt indicator IE with the CATBO bit set to "The back-off timer is applied in the current access type" is included in the 5GSM message with the 5GSM cause value #69 "insufficient resources for specific slice", then the UE applies the timer T3585 for the current access type.
Otherwise, the UE applies the timer T3585 for both 3GPP access type and non-3GPP access type and the UE shall stop any running timer T3585 for the applied PLMN or SNPN and for the access different from the access from which the message is received. In case of SNPN, if the UE does not support access to an SNPN using 5GS session management timers T3584 for the S-NSSAI based congestion holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, in the UE 5GS session management timers T3584 for the S-NSSAI based congestion control are started and subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription basis. In case of SNPN, if the UE does not support access to an SNPN using 5GS session management timers T3585 for the S-NSSAI based congestion holder, equivalent SNPNs or both, in the UE 5GS session management timers T3585 for the S-NSSAI based congestion control are started and subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription basis. If the timer T3584 or timer T3585 was provided during the PDU session establishment procedure, the S-NSSAI associated with T3584 or T3585, respectively is the S-NSSAI, including no S-NSSAI, provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment. If the timer T3584 is provided during the PDU session modification or PDU session release procedure, the UE behaves as follows: The DNN associated with T3584 is the DNN provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment.
If no S-NSSAI but DNN is provided by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, then T3584 is associated with no S-NSSAI and the DNN provided to the network during the PDU session establishment.
If the PDN connection was established when in the S1 mode, then T3584 is associated with no S-NSSAI.
If no DNN but S-NSSAI is provided by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, then T3584 is associated with no DNN and the S-NSSAI of the PDU session.
If no DNN and no S-NSSAI is provided by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, then T3584 is associated with no DNN and no S-NSSAI.
For this purpose, the UE shall memorize the DNN and the S-NSSAI provided to the network during the PDU session establishment.
The timer T3584 associated with no DNN and an S-NSSAI will never be started due to any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session.
If the timer T3584 associated with no DNN and an S-NSSAI is running, it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an If the timer T3585 was provided during the PDU session modification or PDU session release procedure, the UE behaves as follows: if an S-NSSAI was provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment, then T3585 is associated with the S-NSSAI of the PDU session.
If no S-NSSAI is provided by the UE along the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message, then T3585 is associated with no S-NSSAI.

If the UE supports the multi-homed IPv6 PDU session: b) the UE indicates support of the multi-homed IPv6 PDU session: "IPv6" or "IPv4v6" PDU session type; and 2) during the UE-requested PDU session modification performed after an N26 interface, the PDU session is of "IPv6" or "IPv4v6" PDU session type, and the UE has not previously successfully performed the UE-requested PDU session modification to provide this indication. 2 Handling of network rejection not due to congestion control management reject message to regulate the time interval at which the UE may retry the same procedure for 5GSM cause values other than #26 "insufficient resources", #28 "unknown PDU session type", #39 "reactivation requested", #46 "out of LADN service area", #50 "PDU session type IPv4 only allowed", #51 "PDU session type IPv6 only allowed", #54 "PDU session does not exist", #57 "PDU session type IPv4v6 only allowed", #58 "PDU session type Unstructured only allowed", #61 "PDU session type Ethernet only allowed", #67 "insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN", #68 "not supported SSC mode" and #69 "insufficient resources for specific slice".
For 5GSM cause values other than #26 "insufficient resources", #28 "unknown PDU session type", #39 "reactivation requested", #46 "out of LADN service area", #54 "PDU session does not exist", #67 "insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN", #68 "not supported SSC mode", and #69 "insufficient resources for specific slice", and #86 "UAS services not allowed", the network may also include the re-attempt indicator to indicate whether the UE is allowed to re-attempt the corresponding session management procedure for the same DNN in S1 mode after inter-system change. 5GSM cause values other than #27 "missing or unknown DNN", then the UE is blocked from sending another 5GSM request for the same procedure for the same [PLMN, DNN, S-NSSAI], [PLMN, DNN, no S-NSSAI], [PLMN, no DNN, S-NSSAI], or [PLMN, no DNN, no S-NSSAI] combination for the specified duration.
If the network includes this back-off timer value for 5GSM cause value #27 "missing or unknown DNN", then the UE is blocked from sending another 5GSM request for the same procedure for the same [PLMN, DNN], or [PLMN, no DNN] combination for the specified duration.
In an SNPN, if the network includes this back-off timer value for 5GSM cause values other than #27 "missing or unknown DNN", then the UE is blocked from sending another 5GSM request for the same procedure for the same [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, DNN, S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, DNN, no S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN, S-NSSAI], or [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN, no S-NSSAI] combination for the specified duration.
If the network includes this back-off timer value for 5GSM cause value #27 "missing or unknown DNN", then the UE is blocked from sending another 5GSM request for the same procedure for the same [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, DNN], or [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN] combination for the specified duration.
Therefore, the operator needs to exercise caution in determining the use of this timer value. registered in its HPLMN or in an EHPLMN can use the configured SM_RetryAtRATChange value specified in the NAS configuration MO or in the USIM NAS_(CONFIG) file to derive the re-attempt indicator as specified in subclauses and If re-attempt in S1 mode is allowed for 5GSM cause values other than #27 "missing or unknown DNN", the UE shall consider the back-off timer to be applicable only to the 5GS session management in N1 mode for the rejected 5GS session management procedure and the given [PLMN, DNN, S-NSSAI], [PLMN, DNN, no S-NSSAI], [PLMN, no DNN, S-NSSAI], or [PLMN, no DNN, no S-NSSAI] combination.

When DNN, S-NSSAI] combination associated with the back-off timer is the DNN and the mapped S-NSSAI provided by the UE when the PDU session is established.
For 5GSM cause value #27 "missing or unknown DNN", the DNN of the [PLMN, DNN] combination associated with the back-off timer is the DNN provided by the UE when the PDU session is established.
If no DNN or no S-NSSAI was provided to the network during the PDU session establishment, then the back-off timer is associated with the [PLMN, DNN, no S-NSSAI], [PLMN, no DNN, S-NSSAI], or [PLMN, no DNN, no S-NSSAI] combination, dependent on which parameters were provided for 5GSM cause values other than #27 "missing or unknown DNN".
If no DNN was provided to the network during the PDU session establishment, then the back-off timer is associated with the [PLMN, no DNN] combination for 5GSM cause value #27 "missing or unknown DNN".
For this purpose, the UE shall memorize the DNN and the S-NSSAI provided to the network during the PDU modification procedure, the UE behaves as follows: the DNN associated with the back-off timer is the DNN, including no DNN, provided by the UE when the PDU session is established.
If an S-NSSAI was provided by the UE during the PDU session establishment, when the UE is registered in a HPLMN, then the S-NSSAI associated with the back-off timer is the S-NSSAI of the PDU session.
If an S-NSSAI was provided by the UE during then the S-NSSAI associated with the back-off timer is the mapped S-NSSAI of the PDU session.

For this purpose, the UE shall memorize the DNN and the S-NSSAI provided to the network during the PDU session establishment. S-NSSAI], or [PLMN, no DNN] combination will never be started due to any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session.
If the back-off timer associated with the [PLMN, no DNN, no S-NSSAI], or [PLMN, no DNN] combination is running, it does not affect the ability of the UE to request an emergency PDU session. In an SNPN, the back-off timer associated with the [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN, no S-NSSAI], or [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN] combination will never be started due to any 5GSM procedure related to an emergency PDU session.

In an SNPN, the network may additionally indicate in the re-attempt in which the UE received the 5GS session management reject message, but for each SNPN included in the equivalent SNPN list at the time when the 5GS session management reject message was received. given [PLMN, DNN, S-NSSAI], [PLMN, DNN, no S-NSSAI], [PLMN, no DNN, S-NSSAI], [PLMN, no DNN, no S-NSSAI], [PLMN, DNN], or [PLMN, no DNN] selected PLMN, then the UE is allowed to initiate 5GSM procedures for the [PLMN, DNN, S-NSSAI], [PLMN, DNN, no S-NSSAI], [PLMN, no DNN, S-NSSAI], [PLMN, no DNN, no S-NSSAI], [PLMN, DNN], or [PLMN, no DNN] In an SNPN, if the back-off timer is running or is deactivated for a given [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, DNN, S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, DNN, no S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN, S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN, no S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, DNN], or [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN] combination if the UE is a UE configured for high priority access in selected SNPN, then the UE is allowed to initiate 5GSM procedures for the [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, DNN, S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, DNN, no S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN, S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no DNN, no S-NSSAI], [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, DNN], or [SNPN, selected entry of the "list of subscriber data" or selected PLMN subscription, no The RATC bit in the re-attempt indicator IE and its derivation shall not be applicable in an SNPN. 3 Handling of Small data rate control Small data rate control is applicable only to NB-N1 mode and WB-N1 mode. Small data rate control controls the maximum number of uplink user data messages including uplink exception data reporting sent by the UE in a time interval for the PDU session in accordance with 3GPPTS201. The UE shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink user data messages to comply with the small data rate control policy.
The NAS shall provide the indicated rates to upper layers for enforcement.
The value is indicated or the PDU session is released. If the UE indicates support for CIoT 5GS optimizations, the network may provide the small data rate control parameters to the UE and may provide the small data rate control parameters for exception data to the UE if and only if the small data rate control parameters is provided to the UE.
Small data rate control parameters and small data rate control parameters for exception data can also be provided to the UE in S1 mode as specified in 3GPPTS201. If an allowed indication of additional exception reports is provided with the small data rate control parameters and: the additional small data rate control parameters for exception data is provided and the limit for additional rate for exception data reporting is not reached; or the additional small data rate control parameters for exception data the UE is allowed to send uplink exception reports even if the limit for the small data rate control has been reached. was applied to the PDU session that is being released, the network may store the small data rate control status for the released PDU session as.
a) the UE indicates support for CIoT 5GS optimizations; and b) the small data rate control status was stored for the PDU session and the network may provide the remaining small data rate control status as initial small data rate control parameters to the UE and initial small data rate control parameters for exception data to the UE during a subsequent PDU session establishment procedure. apply the initial small data rate control parameters and the initial small data rate control parameters for exception data for the duration of the validity period.
When the validity period expires the small data rate control parameters and the small data rate control parameters for exception data shall be applied (see 3GPPTS201). NOTE1: The HPLMN can discard or delay user data that exceeds the limit provided for small data rate control. Upon inter-system change from N1 mode to S1 mode, the UE shall store the current small data rate control status for PDU sessions to be transferred from N1 mode to S1 mode as specified in 3GPPTS201. NOTE2: How long the UE stores the current small data rate control status is implementation specific. Upon inter-system change from S1 mode to N1 mode, the UE shall use the stored small data rate control status, if any, to comply with the small data rate control policy for PDU sessions transferred from S1 mode to N1 mode as specified in 3GPPTS201, if the validity period of the stored small data rate control status has not expired. 4 Handling of Serving PLMN rate control Serving PLMN rate control is applicable only for PDU sessions established for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization. Serving PLMN rate control protect its AMF from the load generated by user data over control plane. The SMF can inform the UE of any local serving PLMN rate control during the PDU session establishment procedure (see subclause) or the PDU session modification procedure (see subclause).
If serving PLMN rate control is enabled, the SMF shall start the serving PLMN rate control for the PDU session when the first control plane user data is received over the PDU session.
The UE shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink control plane user data to comply with the serving PLMN applies to the PDU session the NAS procedure corresponds to, and the indicated rate is valid until the PDU session is released. Any Serving PLMN rate control information provided by the network to the UE is only applicable for the PLMN which provided this information.
This serving PLMN rate control information shall be discarded when the UE successfully registers to another PLMN. NOTE: The serving PLMN can discard or delay control plane user data that exceed the limit provided for Serving PLMN rate control. 5 Handling of Reliable Data Service If the UE supports Reliable Data Service (see 3GPPTS201 and 3GPPTS250[14A]), the UE may request data transfer using Reliable options IE during UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure (see The Reliable Data Service may only be used with PDU sessions for which the "Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation" indicator is set or with PDU sessions using the control plane CIoT 5GS optimization when the AMF does not move such PDU sessions to the user plane. The network shall inform the UE about the acceptance of UE's request for Reliable Data Service usage during the PDU session establishment procedure (see subclause) in the Extended protocol configuration If the network accepts the use of Reliable Data Service to transfer data for the specified PDU session, the UE shall use this PDU session exclusively for data transfer using Reliable Data Service; otherwise the UE shall not use this PDU session for data transfer using Reliable Dat.
6 Handling of header compression for control plane CIoT optimizations The UE and the SMF may use: IP header compression for PDU sessions of "IPv4", "IPv6" or "IPv4v6" PDU session type; and Ethernet header compression for PDU sessions of "Ethernet" PDU session Both the UE and the AMF indicate whether header compression for control plane CIoT 5GS optimization is supported during registration procedures (see subclause).
If both the UE and the network support header compression, the header compression configuration for each PDU session is negotiated during the PDU session establishment procedure and PDU session modification procedure as specified in subclauses, For IP header compression, ROHC protocol specified in IETFRFC5795[39B] is used.
The IP header compression configuration used for IP header compression is (re-)negotiated between the UE and the SMF using the IP header compression configuration IE as specified in subclauses, , and , respectively. For Ethernet header compression, Ethernet Header Compression (EHC) protocol specified in 3GPP specification document is used.
The Ethernet header compression configuration used for Ethernet header compression is (re-)negotiated between the UE and the SMF using the Ethernet header compression configuration IE as specified in subclauses, , and , respectively. 7 Handling of edge computing enhancements EAS discovery, EAS rediscovery and ECS address provisioning provide enhanced edge computing support in 5GS (see 3GPPTS248[10A]). If the network supports the session breakout connectivity model or distributed anchor connectivity model to enable edge computing enhancements and the UE generated DNS message is to be handled by an edge application server discovery function (EASDF) for EAS discovery as specified in 3GPPTS248[10A], the SMF selects the EASDF and it provides its IP address to the UE as the DNS server to be used for the PDU session in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure as described in NOTE1: EASDF selection is outside the scope of the present document. If the network supports the session breakout connectivity model to enable edge computing enhancements and the UE generated DNS message is 3GPPTS248[10A], the SMF selects the local DNS server, obtains its IP address and can provide the IP address of the local DNS server to the UE as the DNS server to be used for the PDU session in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure or the network-requested PDU session modification procedure as described in subclauses and , NOTE2: Local DNS server selection and the acquisition of its IP address is outside the scope of the present document. If the UE supports EAS rediscovery and the SMF decides to trigger the EAS rediscovery as specified in 3GPPTS248[10A], the SMF initiates a network-requested PDU session modification procedure to provide the EAS rediscovery information to the UE as described in subclauses Upon receipt of the EAS rediscovery information, the UE provides the received information to the upper layers. NOTE3: The upper layers of the UE uses the EAS rediscovery information to trigger the EAS discovery procedure to get the new EAS information as If the UE supports ECS address provisioning over NAS as specified in 3GPPTS248[10A], the UE indicates its support of ECS configuration information provisioning over NAS in the Extended protocol configuration options IE either during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure as described in subclause or while in S1 mode as described in 3GPPTS201, respectively. If the UE indicated support of ECS configuration information address provisioning over NAS, the SMF can provide the ECS configuration information in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the network-requested PDU session modification procedure, UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure or the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure as described in subclauses, and NOTE4: The SMF can obtain the ECS configuration information based on the local configuration, the UE's location, the UE's subscription information, or any combination of them. If the UE supports the edge DNS client (EDC) as specified in 3GPPTS248[10A], the UE indicates its support of EDC in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure as described in subclause or the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure as described in If the UE indicates support of EDC, the SMF can indicate in the Extended protocol configuration options IE during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure as described in subclause or the network-requested PDU session modification procedure as described in subclause, that the network allows the use of EDC for the applications which are mapped onto the PDU session and explicitly requested the use of EDC, or that the network requires the use of EDC for all applications mapped onto the PDU session. 8 Support of redundant PDU sessions The 5GSM sublayer may support establishment of redundant PDU sessions (see subclause of 3GPPTS201). ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message for each of the two redundant PDU sessions (see subclause).
The UE can set the PDU session pair ID, the RSN, or both according to URSP or UE local configuration (see SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message operates as specified in subclause of 3GPPTS201.
In addition, an SMF can handle message for each of the PDU sessions (see subclause of 9 Handling of maximum group data rate limitation control The network can perform maximum group data rate limitation control to 5G VN groups as specified in 3GPPTS203.
If the maximum data rate of PDU sessions associated within a 5G VN group has been exceeded the maximum group data rate of the 5G VN group, the SMF may reject the PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message against the 5G VN group using S-NSSAI based congestion control as specified in subclause and NOTE1: The maximum group data rate limitation control does not apply in selected PLMN or SNPN. NOTE2: The maximum group data rate limitation control is performed by PDU session authentication and authorization procedure.
The purpose of the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure is to enable the DN: a) to authenticate the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the PDU b) to authorize the upper layers of the UE, when establishing the PDU c) both of the above; or d) to re-authenticate the upper layers of the UE after establishment of The PDU session authentication and authorization procedure can be performed only during or after the UE-requested PDU session procedure and authorization procedure shall not be performed during or after the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure establishing an credentials, if any, for the PDU session authentication and If the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN the SMF may initiate the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure If the UE is registered for onboarding services in SNPN and the network initiates the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure, the UE shall use the default UE credentials for secondary authentication for the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure. The network authenticates the UE using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) as specified in IETFRFC3748. EAP has defined four types of EAP messages: a) an EAP-request message; b) an EAP-response message; c) an EAP-success message; and d) an EAP-failure message. The EAP-request message is transported from the network to the UE using the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMMAND message of the PDU EAP message The EAP-response message to the EAP-request message is transported from the UE to the network using the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE message of the PDU EAP message reliable transport procedure. If the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure is performed during the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure: a) and the DN authentication of the UE completes successfully, the EAP-success message is transported from the network to the UE as part of the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION b) and the DN authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully, the EAP-failure message is transported from the network to the UE as part of the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure in the PDU SESSION If the PDU session authentication and authorization procedure is performed after the UE-requested PDU session establishment procedure: a) and the DN authentication of the UE completes successfully, the EAP-success message is transported from the network to the UE using the PDU SESSION AUTHENTICATION RESULT message of the PDU EAP result message b) and the DN authentication of the UE completes unsuccessfully, the EAP-failure message is transported from the network to the UE using the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message of the network-requested PDU session There can be several rounds of exchange of an EAP-request message and a related EAP-response message for the DN to complete the authentication The SMF shall set the authenticator retransmission timer specified in IETFRFC3748 subclause to infinite value.

NOTE3: As described in this subclause, upon PLMN change, SNPN change, or inter-system change, the UE does not stop the timer T3584 or T358 This means the timer T3584 or T3585 can still be running or be deactivated for the given 5GSM procedure, the PLMN, the S-NSSAI and optionally the DNN combination when the UE returns to the PLMN or when it performs inter-system change back from S1 mode to N1 mode.
Thus the UE can still be prevented from sending another PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST or PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message in the PLMN for the same S-NSSAI and optionally the same DNN.

If the SMF receives an exemptionInd attribute indicating "message was exempted from the DNN based congestion activated in the AMF" as specified in 3GPPTS202[20A], and the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message does not indicate 3GPP PS data off UE status, then the SMF shall set the 5GSM cause #26 "insufficient resources" in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION e) AMF provides a "message was exempted from the S-NSSAI and DNN based congestion activated in the AMF" but the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure is not exempt from S-NSSAI only based congestion If the SMF receives an exemptionInd attribute indicating "message was exempted from the S-NSSAI and DNN based congestion activated in the AMF" as specified in 3GPPTS202[20A], and the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message does not indicate 3GPP PS data off UE status, then the SMF shall set the 5GSM cause #67 "insufficient resources for specific slice and DNN" in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message. f) AMF provides a "message was exempted from the S-NSSAI only based congestion activated in the AMF" but the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure is not exempt from S-NSSAI only based congestion If the SMF receives an exemptionInd attribute indicating "message was exempted from the S-NSSAI only based congestion activated in the AMF" as specified in 3GPPTS202[20A], and the Extended protocol configuration options IE of the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REQUEST message does not indicate 3GPP PS data off UE status, then the SMF shall set the 5GSM cause #69 "insufficient resources for specific slice" in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message. g) 5G access network cannot forward the message. If the SMF determines based on content of the n2SmInfo attribute specified in 3GPPTS202[20A] that the DL NAS TRANSPORT message carrying the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message was not forwarded procedure in progress, then the SMF shall reject the UE-requested PDU session modification procedure with an appropriate 5GSM cause value in the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION REJECT message. NOTE: The use of an appropriate 5GSM cause value is implementation UE-requested PDU session release procedure.
The purpose of the UE-requested PDU session release procedure is to The UE is allowed to initiate the PDU session release procedure even if the timer T3396 is running. The UE is allowed to initiate the PDU session release procedure even if the timer T3584 is running. The UE is allowed to initiate the PDU session release procedure even if the timer T3585 is running. The UE is allowed to initiate the PDU session release procedure even if the UE is outside the LADN service area. UE-requested PDU session release procedure initiation In order to initiate the UE-requested PDU session release procedure, the The UE may set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message to indicate the reason for releasing the PDU session. The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following 5GSM cause #44 Semantic errors in packet filter(s); #45 Syntactical error in packet filter(s); #83 Semantic error in the QoS operation; #84 Syntactical error in the QoS operation; #96 Invalid mandatory information. PTI IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message to the allocated PTI The UE shall transport the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message and the PDU session ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause, and the UE shall start timer T3582 (see example in If the UE is releasing the PDU session due to: a) errors in QoS operations or packet filters; or b) the number of the authorized QoS rules, the number of the packet filters, or the number of the authorized QoS flow descriptions associated with the PDU session have reached the maximum number supported by the UE, the UE shall include the 5GSM cause IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message as described in subclauses and Figure: UE-requested PDU session release procedure UE-requested PDU session release procedure accepted by the network ID, if the SMF accepts the request to release the PDU session, and shall perform the network-requested PDU session release procedure as specified UE-requested PDU session release procedure not accepted by the network not accept the request to release the PDU session, the SMF shall create a PDU SESSION RELEASE REJECT message. The SMF shall set the 5GSM cause IE of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REJECT message to indicate the reason for rejecting the PDU session release. The 5GSM cause IE typically indicates one of the following SM cause #35 PTI already in use; or #43 Invalid PDU session identity; or #95 – 111: protocol errors. The SMF shall send the PDU SESSION RELEASE REJECT message. ID, using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause, the UE shall stop timer T3582, release the allocated PTI value and locally release the PDU session.
If there is one or more multicast MBS sessions associated with the PDU session, the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions. Abnormal cases in the UE The following abnormal cases can be identified: a) Expiry of timer T358 The UE shall, on the first expiry of the timer T3582, retransmit the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message and the PDU session information which was transported together with the initial transmission of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message and shall reset and start timer T358 This retransmission is repeated four times, i.
on the fifth expiry of timer T3582, the UE shall abort the procedure, release the allocated registration procedure for mobility and periodic registration update by IE over each access that user plane resources have been established if the PDU session is an MA PDU session, or over the access the PDU session there is one or more multicast MBS sessions associated with the PDU session, the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS b) Collision of UE-requested PDU session release procedure and network-requested PDU session modification procedure. the UE-requested PDU session release procedure, and the PDU session indicated in PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message is the PDU session that the UE had requested to release, the UE shall ignore the PDU SESSION MODIFICATION COMMAND message and proceed with the PDU session c) Collision of UE-requested PDU session release procedure and network-requested PDU session release procedure. IE set to "No procedure transaction identity assigned" during the UE-requested PDU session release procedure, the PDU session indicated in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message is the same as the PDU session that the UE requests to release: if the Access type IE is included in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message and the PDU session is an MA PDU session and having user-plane resources established on the access different from the access indicated in the Access type IE in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND message, the UE shall proceed both the UE-requested PDU session release procedure and network-requested PDU session release procedure; or otherwise, the UE shall abort the UE-requested PDU session release procedure and shall stop the timer T3582 and proceed with the network-requested PDU session release procedure. NOTE1: Whether the UE ignores the 5GSM cause #39"reactivation requested" if received in the PDU SESSION RELEASE COMMAND is up to the d) Receipt of an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due Upon receiving an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due the PDU session ID IE set to the same value as the PDU session ID that was sent by the UE, the UE shall stop timer T3582, abort the procedure, and perform the registration procedure for mobility and periodic the PDU session status IE over each access that user plane resources have been established if the PDU session is an MA PDU session, or over the access the PDU session is associated with if the PDU session is a single access PDU session.
If there is one or more multicast MBS sessions associated with the released PDU session, the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions. e) PDU session release signalling restricted due to service area The UE may delay the release of the PDU session until the UE is not restricted by service area restrictions, or it may release the allocated session status IE over each access that user plane resources have been established if the PDU session is an MA PDU session, or over the access PDU when performing the next registration procedure.
If the UE performs the local release of the PDU session and there is one or more multicast MBS sessions associated with the released PDU session, the UE shall locally leave the associated multicast MBS sessions. f) Collision of UE-requested PDU session release procedure and N1 NAS The UE may immediately retransmit the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message and stop, reset and restart timer T3582, if the following 1) The original UE-requested PDU session release procedure was initiated over an existing N1 NAS signalling connection; and 2) the previous transmission of the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message was not initiated due to timer T3582 expiry. g) Receipt of an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded due to the PLMN is not allowed to operate at the present UE location Upon receiving an indication that the 5GSM message was not forwarded the PLMN is not allowed to operate at the present UE location along with a PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message with the PDU session ID IE set to the same value as the PDU session ID that was sent by the UE, the UE shall stop timer T3582, abort the procedure and locally release the PDU Abnormal cases on the network side The following abnormal cases can be identified: a) PDU session inactive for the received PDU session identity. If the PDU session ID in the PDU SESSION RELEASE REQUEST message belongs to any PDU session in state PDU SESSION INACTIVE in the SMF, the SMF shall send the PDU SESSION RELEASE REJECT message to the UE with the 5GSM cause #43 "Invalid PDU session identity"..
The purpose of the sending of the 5GSM STATUS message is to report at any time certain error conditions detected upon receipt of 5GSM protocol data.
The 5GSM STATUS message can be sent by both the network and the UE (see example in figure). Figure: 5GSM status procedure 5GSM status received in the UE If the 5GSM entity of the UE receives a 5GSM STATUS message the UE shall take different actions depending on the received 5GSM cause value: The UE shall abort any ongoing 5GSM procedure related to the received PTI value and stop any related timer. #81 invalid PTI value. The UE shall abort any ongoing 5GSM procedure related to the received PTI value and stop any related timer. #97 Message type non-existent or not implemented. The UE shall abort any ongoing 5GSM procedure related to the PTI or PDU session ID and stop any related timer. On receipt of a 5GSM STATUS message with any other 5GSM cause value no state transition and no specific action shall be taken as seen from the radio interface, i.

The procedures specified in the present document apply to those messages which pass the checks described in this subclause. This subclause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity.
These procedures are called "error handling procedures", but in addition to providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocols. Subclauses to shall be applied in order of precedence. Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent and may vary from PLMN to PLMN.
However, when extensions of this protocol are developed, networks are assumed to have the error handling which is indicated in this subclause as mandatory ("shall") and that is indicated as strongly recommended ("should"). Also, the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see Message too short or too long message type information element, that message shall be ignored, cf. is specified in 3GPPTS202 Unknown or unforeseen procedure transaction identity or PDU Session identity The following network procedures shall apply for handling an unknown, erroneous, or unforeseen PTI received in a 5GSM message: COMMAND REJECT message in which the PTI value is an assigned or unassigned value that does not match any PTI in use, the network shall respond with a 5GSM STATUS message including 5GSM cause #47 "PTI PTI value is an assigned value, the network shall respond with a 5GSM STATUS message including 5GSM cause #81 "invalid PTI value".

This clause defines the structure of the messages of the Layer3 (L3) protocols defined in the present document.
These are standard L3 messages as defined in 3GPPTS207. Each definition given in the present clause includes: a) a brief description of the message direction and use, including whether the message has: Local significance, i.
relevant only on the originating or Access significance, i.
relevant in the originating and terminating access, but not in the network; Dual significance, i.
relevant in either the originating or terminating access and in the network; or Global significance, i.
relevant in the originating and terminating access and in the network. b) a table listing the Information Elements (IE) known in the message and the order of their appearance in the message.
All IEs that may be which compose the imperative part of the message, occur before the T, TV, TLV and TLV-E formatted IEs which compose the non-imperative part of the message, see 3GPPTS207).
In a (maximal) sequence of consecutive IEs with half octet length, the first IE with half octet always has an even number of elements. For each information element the table indicates: The Information Element Identifier (IEI), in hexadecimal notation, if digit followed by a "-" (example: B-). NOTE1: The same IEI can be used for different information element types in different messages of the same protocol. then the same IEI can be used for different information element types in the Type 6 IE container information element and in other parts of the The name of the information element (which may give an idea of the semantics of the element).
The name of the information element followed by "IE" or "information element" is used in this technical report as The name of the type of the information element (which indicates the coding of the value part of the IE), and generally, the referenced subclause of clause9 of the present document describing the value part of the information element. TLV-E) as defined in 3GPPTS207. The length of the information element (or permissible range of lengths), in octets, in the message, where "?" means that the maximum length of the IE is only constrained by link layer protocol.
This c) subclauses specifying, where appropriate, conditions for IEs with other conditions specified in the present document define when the information elements shall be included or not, what non-presence of such IEs means, and – for IEs with presence requirement C – the static conditions for presence or non-presence of the IEs or for both cases 5GS mobility management messages The AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message is sent by the AMF to the UE to initiate authentication of the UE identity.

section identifiers (UPSIs) during the UE-initiated UE state indication procedure.
The UPSI is composed of two parts: a) a PLMN ID part containing: 1) the PLMN ID for the PLMN; or 2) the PLMN ID part of the SNPN identity for the SNPN; of the PCF which provides the UE policies; and During the UE-initiated UE state indication procedure, the UE also provides the PCF with the UE policy related capabilities such as the UE's support for ANDSP, the UE's support for URSP provisioning in EPS, and the UE's OSId. During the network-requested UE policy management procedure, the PCF provides the UE with one or more UE policy sections containing UE policies.
The UE processes the received UE policy sections, each identified by the UPSI, received from the PCF and informs the PCF of the In the present annex, the condition that the PLMN ID part of the UPSI is referring to the HPLMN shall be considered as fulfilled only if the PLMN ID is equal to the HPLMN code derived from the IMSI. even if the EHPLMN list does not include the PLMN ID derived from the The UE can also request the PCF to provide V2XP as specified in The UE can also request the PCF to provide ProSeP as specified in The UE can also request the PCF to provide A2XP as specified in The UE can also request the PCF to provide RSLPP as specified in D.

Network-requested UE policy management procedure.
The purpose of the network-requested UE policy management procedure is to enable the network to: a) add one or more new UE policy sections to the UE; b) modify one or more UE policy sections stored at the UE; or c) delete one or more UE policy sections stored at the UE; and optionally to enable the HPLMN or the subscribed SNPN to provide a signalled URSP handling indication indicating whether the UE is allowed to accept URSP signalled by non-subscribed SNPNs. D.
Network-requested UE policy management procedure initiation In order to initiate the network-requested UE policy management procedure, the PCF shall: a) if the network-requested UE policy management procedure is triggered by the UE-requested V2X policy provisioning procedure as specified in 3GPPTS287[19B], the UE-requested ProSe policy provisioning procedure as specified in 3GPPTS254[19E] or the UE-requested A2X policy provisioning procedure as specified in 3GPPTS277, then set the PTI IE to the PTI value of the received UE POLICY PROVISIONING REQUEST message of the UE-requested V2X policy provisioning procedure, the UE-requested ProSe policy provisioning procedure or the UE-requested currently not used and set the PTI IE to the allocated PTI value; b) encode the information about the UE policy sections to be added, message and set the non-subscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication of the UE policy network classmark IE to "UE is not allowed to accept URSP signalled by non-subscribed SNPNs", or "UE is allowed to accept URSP signalled by non-subscribed SNPNs"; c1) if the UE supports VPS URSP, optionally encode the information about entries of VPS URSP configuration to be added, modified or deleted in the VPS URSP configuration IE as specified in subclauseD.
and d) send the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message to the UE via the AMF as specified in 3GPPTS202; and e) start timer T3501 (see example in figureD.
: Network-requested UE policy management procedure procedure, for each instruction included in the UE policy section management list IE, the UE shall: a) store the received UE policy section of the instruction, if the UE has no stored UE policy section associated with the same UPSI as the UPSI associated with the instruction; b) replace the stored UE policy section with the received UE policy associated with the same UPSI as the UPSI associated with the section associated with the same UPSI as the UPSI associated with the instruction and the UE policy section of the instruction is empty; additionally, if the UE policy network classmark IE is included in the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message, and a) the UE has an empty EHPLMN list or the EHPLMN list is not present, and the UE's RPLMN is the HPLMN; c) the UE's RSNPN is the subscribed SNPN, the UE shall delete the non-subscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication stored for the selected entry of "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription, if any, and store the non-subscribed SNPN signalled URSP handling indication received in the UE policy network classmark IE, for the selected entry of "list of subscriber data" or the selected PLMN subscription. If the UE supports the VPS URSP, and the VPS URSP configuration is included in the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message: a) if the replacement type field of the received VPS URSP configuration indicates "full list of tuples", the UE shall delete the stored VPS URSP configuration, if any; and b) if the received VPS URSP configuration contains one or more tuples: 1) if the UE does not have the stored VPS URSP configuration, the UE shall store the received VPS URSP configuration except zero or more tuples with no UPSCs; or no UPSCs, the UE shall delete the tuple with the tuple ID from the stored VPS URSP configuration; or one or more UPSCs, the UE shall replace the tuple with the tuple ID in the stored VPS URSP configuration with the tuple with the tuple ID from the received VPS URSP configuration; or B) if no tuple with the tuple ID is in the received VPS URSP configuration, the UE shall keep the tuple with the tuple ID in the stored VPS URSP configuration; and configuration, if no tuple with the tuple ID is in the stored VPS URSP A) the tuple with the tuple ID in the received VPS URSP configuration contains no UPSCs, the UE shall ignore the tuple with the tuple ID in the received VPS URSP configuration; or B) the tuple with the tuple ID in the received VPS URSP configuration contains one or more UPSCs, the UE shall add the tuple with the tuple ID from the received VPS URSP configuration to the stored VPS URSP SNPN when the UE registers in another PLMN or SNPN.
If necessary, the UE the HPLMN or for an SNPN other than the registered SNPN and the subscribed SNPN, before storing the new received UE policy sections. associate the NID of that SNPN with the UPSI of the stored UE policy NOTE: The maximum number of UE policy sections for PLMNs or SNPNs other than the HPLMN and the RPLMN or the registered SNPN and the subscribed SNPN that the UE can store and how the UE selects the UE policy sections to be deleted are up to the UE implementation. D.

NOTE: The way to achieve this is implementation dependent.
For example, the PCF can ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released during the time equal to or greater than the default value of D.
Network-requested UE policy management procedure not accepted by the UE If the UE could not execute all instructions included in the UE policy section management list IE successfully, the UE shall: a) set the PTI IE to the PTI value received within the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND message and encode the results by including: 1) the UPSI associated with the instructions which could not be executed 2) the failed instruction order set to order of the instruction in the UE policy section management sublist of the received UE policy section management list IE which could not be executed successfully; and 3) the cause of the failure, in the UE policy section management result IE as specified in b) transport the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message using the NAS transport procedure as specified in subclause Upon receipt of the MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message, the PCF shall stop timer T350 Any instruction that was included in the UE policy section management list IE but not indicatedin the UE policy section management result IE of the received MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message, shall be considered as successfully executed. The PCF should ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is NOTE: The way to achieve this is implementation dependent.
For example, the PCF can ensure that the PTI value assigned to this procedure is not released during the time equal to or greater than the default value of Upon receipt of the notification from the AMF that the UE is not reachable, the PCF shall stop the T350 D.

8 Handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous UPDS data.
The procedures specified in the subclause apply to those messages which pass the checks described in this subclause. This subclause also specifies procedures for the handling of unknown, unforeseen, and erroneous UPDS data by the receiving entity.
These procedures are called "error handling procedures", but in addition to providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the UPDS. SubclausesD.
shall be applied in order of precedence. Detailed error handling procedures in the network are implementation dependent and may vary from PLMN to PLMN.
However, when extensions of UPDS are developed, networks are assumed to have the error handling which is indicated in this subclause as mandatory ("shall") and that is indicated as strongly recommended ("should"). Also, the error handling of the network is only considered as mandatory or strongly recommended when certain thresholds for errors are not For definition of semantical and syntactical errors see D.
Message too short or too long D.
Message too short message type information element, that message shall be ignored, c.
Message too long D.
Unknown or unforeseen procedure transaction identity D.
Procedure transaction identity The following network procedures shall apply for handling an unknown, MANAGE UE POLICY COMMAND REJECT message in which the PTI value is an assigned or unassigned value that does not match any PTI in use, the network shall ignore the UPDS message. a reserved value, the network shall ignore the UPDS message. The following UE procedures shall apply for handling an unknown, reserved value, the UE shall ignore the UPDS message. D.
Unknown or unforeseen message type defined for the UPDS or not implemented by the receiver, it shall ignore NOTE: A message type not defined for the UPDS in the given direction is shall ignore the UPDS message. the network actions are implementation dependent. D.
Non-semantical mandatory information element errors a) an "imperative message part" error; or b) a "missing mandatory IE" error a) a syntactically incorrect mandatory IE; b) an IE with an IEI unknown in the message, but encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPPTS207); or c) an out of sequence IE encoded as "comprehension required" (see the UE shall ignore the UPDS message; the network shall proceed as follows: 1) try to treat the message (the exact further actions are 2) ignore the message. D.
Unknown and unforeseen IEs in the non-imperative message part D.
IEIs unknown in the message as "comprehension required" (see 3GPPTS207). The network shall take the same approach. D.
Out of sequence IEs encoded as "comprehension required" (see 3GPPTS207). The network should take the same approach. specified in subclauseD.
5, the UE shall handle only the contents of the information element appearing first and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element.
When repetition of information elements is specified, the UE shall handle only the contents of specified repeated information elements.
If the limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded, the UE shall handle the contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of repetitions and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the information element. The network should follow the same procedures. D.
Non-imperative message part errors a) syntactically incorrect optional IEs; and b) conditional IE errors. D.
Syntactically incorrect optional IEs The UE shall treat all optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a message as not present in the message. The network shall take the same approach. D.
Conditional IE errors conditional IE" error or an "unexpected conditional IE" error, or when incorrect conditional IE, the UE shall ignore the message. IE" error or an "unexpected conditional IE" error or when it receives a message containing at least one syntactically incorrect conditional IE, the network shall either: a) try to treat the message (the exact further actions are b) ignore the message. D.
Messages with semantically incorrect contents shall perform the foreseen reactions of the procedural part of subclausesD.
If, however no such reactions are specified, the UE shall ignore the message. The network should follow the same procedure. Annex E (informative): Void Annex F (informative): Change history.
