An attempt at replicating Bookworm Game: Automatic Discovery of LTE Vulnerabilities Through Documentation Analysis by Chen et al.

The RODExtender kind of works, but:
- demo.txt is only a placeholder and does not return any RODs
- models and data have to be downloaded for this to work
- I have to trim down environment dependencies (CiRA & SPEC5G dependencies + spacy, ...)
